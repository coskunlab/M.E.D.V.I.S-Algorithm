Supplementary Figure 11. Conversion of 2D spatial coordinates to 1D spatial distributions
for KS Hypothesis Testing.
(a) Example illustration of 2D cell focusing on two arbitrary protein markers: green and magenta.
The black star denotes the cell’s center of mass computed from the cell segmentation mask.

(b) Calculated distances from each protein (green, magenta) pixel to the center of mass resulting
in 1D histograms of spatial distances. KS Hypothesis Testing determines if the two signals (green
and magenta) come from significantly different underlying distributions. Created with

(c) Example BM cell 1 with significantly (p-value ≤ 0.0001) different underlying distributions for
the target mitochondria organelle labeled by HSP60 (magenta) and TOM20 (green) protein
markers. See Fig. 4d for complete cells.
(d) Example BM cell 2 with no significant statistical difference in mitochondria spatial expression
between HSP60 (magenta) and TOM20 (green) protein markers. See Fig. 4d for complete cells.
