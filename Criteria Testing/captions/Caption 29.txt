Supplementary Figure 9. Validation of bleaching protocol for segmentation markers
Phalloidin and WGA.
(a) Images of before staining (left column), staining (middle column), and after bleaching (right
column) of Phalloidin (yellow). Before and after bleaching images confirm signal addition and
removal before the next staining cycle. All scale bars 10 µm. On the right, the intensity sum of
ten regions before staining, staining, and after bleaching is quantified to validate the effect of the
fluorophore bleaching process. Before (red) and after bleach (blue) show comparable intensities
while marker (green) illustrates approximately 2-3-fold higher intensity.
(b) Images of before staining (left column), staining (middle column), and after bleaching (right
column) of WGA (red). Before and after bleaching images confirm signal addition and removal
before the next staining cycle. All scale bars 10 µm. On the right, the intensity sum of ten regions
before staining, staining, and after bleaching is quantified to validate the effect of the fluorophore
bleaching process. Before (red) and after bleach (blue) show comparable intensities while marker
(green) illustrates approximately 2-7-fold higher intensity.
