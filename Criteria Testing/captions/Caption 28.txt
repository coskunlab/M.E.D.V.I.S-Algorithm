Supplementary Figure 8. Validation of bleaching protocol for indirect and direct IF with
HSP60.
(a) Images of before staining (left column), staining (middle column), and after bleaching (right
column) of HSP60 (green) for indirect IF. Before and after bleaching images confirm signal
addition and removal before the next staining cycle. All scale bars 10 µm. On the right, the
intensity sum of ten regions before staining, staining, and after bleaching is quantified to validate
the effect of the fluorophore bleaching process. Before (red) and after bleach (blue) show
comparable intensities while marker (green) illustrates approximately 1.5-2-fold higher intensity.
(b) Images of before staining (left column), staining (middle column), and after bleaching (right
column) of HSP60 (green) for direct IF. Before and after bleaching images confirm signal addition
and removal before the next staining cycle. Some green background remains after bleaching but
this is uniform outside the cell and is easily removed. All scale bars 10 µm. On the right, the
intensity sum of ten regions before staining, staining, and after bleaching is quantified to validate
the effect of the fluorophore bleaching process. Before (red) and after bleach (blue) show
comparable intensities while marker (green) illustrates approximately 2-fold higher intensity.
