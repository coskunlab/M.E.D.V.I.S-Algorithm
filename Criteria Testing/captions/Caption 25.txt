Supplementary Figure 5. Pixel overlap colocalization of markers in BM MSCs (n=7).
(a) Pixel overlap colocalization of 5 markers (ATF6, DAPI, GOLPH4, Nucleolin, TOM20) in BM
MSCs per marker for each cell (n=7) plotted as heatmaps. The color bar ranges from 0 (blue) to
0.25 (red) and indicates the fraction of the cell occupied by the marker pair. BM cells 1, 2, and 4
exhibit slightly different organelle patterns than BM cells 3, 5, 6, and 7. DAPI & Nucleolin, ATF6
& TOM20, ATF6 & GOLPH4, and TOM20 & GOLPH4 exhibit the highest pixel overlap
colocalizations.
(b) Average (top) and standard deviation (bottom) of pixel overlap colocalization per marker
across all BM MSCs for 5 markers (ATF6, DAPI, GOLPH4, Nucleolin, TOM20). The color bar
ranges from 0 (blue) to 0.25 (red). DAPI & Nucleolin, ATF6 & TOM20, ATF6 & GOLPH4, and
TOM20 & GOLPH4 exhibit the highest pixel overlap colocalizations. Standard deviations are
mostly low, indicating less single-cell variation.
