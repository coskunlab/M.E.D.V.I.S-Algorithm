Supplementary Figure 6. Pixel overlap colocalization of markers in UC MSCs (n=7).
(a) Pixel overlap colocalization of 5 markers (ATF6, DAPI, GOLPH4, Nucleolin, TOM20) in UC
MSCs per marker for each cell (n=7) plotted as heatmaps. The color bar ranges from 0 (blue) to
0.76 (red). TOM20 and ATF6 show high colocalization in all cells except UC cells 4 and 5,
suggesting crosstalk between mitochondria and ER in most UC MSCs. Nucleolin and DAPI also
exhibit high colocalization, indicating some segregation of nuclear and cytosolic organelles.
(b) Average (top) and standard deviation (bottom) of pixel overlap colocalization per marker
across all BM MSCs for 5 markers (ATF6, DAPI, GOLPH4, Nucleolin, TOM20). The color bar
ranges from 0 (blue) to 0.76 (red) for average and 0 (blue) to 1 (red) for standard deviation. The
highest average colocalization exists between DAPI & Nucleolin, and ATF6 & TOM20. Thus,
many UC MSCs exhibit crosstalk between mitochondria and ER while nuclear organelles are more
separated from cytosolic ones. The low standard deviation shows most cells behave similarly.
