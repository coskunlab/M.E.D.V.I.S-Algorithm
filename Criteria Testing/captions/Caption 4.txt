FIG. 4. Spatial quantification of single cell
differences between retina organoid and
tissue.
(A) Relative phenotypic abundances among all
organoid (green) and tissue (blue) samples. Rods are
the most dominant of both types, whereas ACs, BCs,
and RGCs are comparable. Organoids exhibited less
sample variability (more uniform abundances) than
tissues.
(B) Single cell phenotype presence in retina organoid
(green) and tissue (blue). Normalized distances of cells
to elliptical fit from Figure 2B in descending order
mimicking the ideal retinal layer structure. Statistical
comparison of the spatial elliptical arrangement using
one-way ANOVA with post hoc Tukey test (*p-value
<0.05, **p-value <0.01, ***p-value <0.001, ****p-value
<0.0001). Only significance between adjacent retinal
layers is shown. ANOVA, analysis of variance.
