Supplementary Figure 4. Pearson’s correlation of markers in UC MSCs (n=7).
(a) Correlation values of the total intensity of 5 markers (ATF6, DAPI, GOLPH4, Nucleolin,
TOM20) in UC MSCs were calculated per marker for each cell using Pearson’s Correlation and
plotted as heatmaps. Pearson’s correlation values range from -1 (blue) to +1 (red).
(b) Average (top) and standard deviation (bottom) of Pearson’s correlation of intensity per marker
across all UC MSCs for 5 markers (ATF6, DAPI, GOLPH4, Nucleolin, TOM20). The color bar
ranges from -1 (blue) to +1 (red). Standard deviation values are close to 0 while average values
agree well with every single cell in (a) except for UC cells 5 and 7, indicating a less uniform
organelle pattern among UC MSCs.
