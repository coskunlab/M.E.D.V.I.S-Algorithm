FIG. 5. Local single cell neighborhood associations in retinal organoids and tissues.
(A) Cell neighborhood associations within retinal organoids. A single organoid section is shown (left column). Example of zoomed cell
regions (middle column) with corresponding five-neighbor heatmap (right column). The top row shows a more layered organoid example,
and the bottom row shows a less organized sample. Right column heatmaps illustrate the number of five nearest cell neighbors for each cell
phenotype. Red indicates more neighbors of that phenotype, whereas blue indicates fewer neighbors. In more layered regions, MG and rods
exhibit the most segregation among cell types. For less organized regions, the heatmap shows more mixing among cell types except for HC.
(B) Cell neighborhood associations within retinal tissues. A single tissue section is shown (left column). Example of zoomed cell regions
(middle column) with corresponding five-neighbor heatmap (right column) for layered sample (top row) and less organization sample
(bottom row). Right column heatmaps quantify the count of five nearest cell neighbors for each cell phenotype. Red indicates more
neighbors of that phenotype, whereas blue indicates fewer neighbors. The top row illustrates a more layered sample, whereas the bottom
row shows a more disconnected sample. Rods are the thickest (most segregated) layer in the top row, whereas there exists more segregation
of BC and rods in the disorganized bottom row.
