FIG. 2. Comparison case study of retinal organoid and tissue.
(A) (Top row) Retinal organoids, derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells, form 3D retinal tissue in culture.41 Example image
renders of single cell phenotypes including rods (yellow), cones (purple), BC (orange), MG (blue), RGC (green), HC (pink), and AC (red).
(Bottom row) Mouse retina tissue MERFISH data illustrate spatial gene expression in high throughput.40 Example image renders of single cell
phenotypes include rods (yellow), cones (purple), BC (orange), MG (blue), RGC (green), HC (pink), and AC (red).
(B) Spatial comparison of retinal organoid (top row) and tissue (bottom row) transcriptomic data at the cell phenotype level. Retina structure
was defined as an elliptical fit (green) on representative single cells (black dots) from each 2D section. Similarly, the organoid fit is shown in
green as well. These fits were treated as landmarks to describe the structural fidelity of the samples. The right graph shows each cell’s
distance to the elliptical fit for both the organoid and tissue sample. A two-sided Mann–Whitney U test of statistical significance was used to
compare the same cell types from the organoid and tissue sample (*p-value <0.05, **p-value <0.01, ***p-value <0.001, ****p-value <0.0001).
