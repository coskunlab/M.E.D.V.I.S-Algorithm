FIG. 1. Emerging 3D organoid applications in regenerative and personalized medicine.
(A) Patient-derived stem cells can be reprogrammed in situ to form organoids, 3D models of organ structure, and development. When
combined with spatial transcriptomic labeling, gene and signaling networks in single cells are observed in 3D space during organogenesis.
(B) Case study example of a retinal organoid model resembling native eye function. The spatial organization of gene expression and cell
phenotypes informs how organoids compare with native tissue counterparts in terms of molecular, structural, and functional aspects.
(C) Physiologically relevant organoid characteristics including different assays to measure the molecular, structural, and functional aspects.
Molecular aspects typically involve single cell phenotype profiling (e.g., ganglions, rods, cones, other photoreceptors) with RNA sequencing, for
example. Structural characteristics describe how faithfully organoids recapitulate native organ structure, which is imperative in studying organ
development and biology. Structural assays include spatial omics, or image-based, techniques such as MERFISH, IF, and IHC. These techniques
highlight single molecules (e.g., RNA, protein) within single cells. Functional characteristics describe the organoid’s ability to execute its
corresponding organ function. For example, retinal organoids should ideally convert light to electrical signals to propagate an image to the
brain. To accomplish this, photoreceptors should hyperpolarize in response to color or light, which is how organisms perceive images. Created
