Supplementary Figure 7. VR-based visualization of organelle imaging data in MSCs.
Visualization of organelle protein images (10 markers) for one UC MSC in ConfocalVR. For each
cell, the top shows the RGB image of the combined markers, while the bottom two show a single
marker image in either red or green with DAPI. Different organelle markers are illustrated across
the columns. Merged images are shown in the first row. Column 1: ATF6 (middle row) &
Concanavalin A (bottom row), Column 2: Beta Tubulin (middle row) & Nucleolin (bottom row),
Column 3: GOLPH4 (middle row) & Sortilin (bottom row), Column 4: Phalloidin (middle row) &
WGA (bottom row), Column 5: TOM20 (middle row) & HSP60 (bottom row). Handset toggle
switches used to interact with the image are shown on the left and right sides.
