Figure 3. SpaGNN reveals subcellular gene neighborhood network variability

(A) Two patches in a fibroblast. The nearest neighborhood networks of the two patches are shown in (C).

(B) Two patches in a U2-OS cell.

(C) Gene neighborhood networks of the two patches shown in (A) between THBS1, FBN2, and SRRM2. THBS1-FBN2 has a positive proximity score in the left patch and a negative proximity score in the right patch.

(D) Gene neighborhood networks of the two patches shown in (B) between THBS1, FBN2, and SRRM2. THBS1-FBN2 has a negative proximity score in the left patch and a positive proximity score in the right patch. Furthermore, THBS1-SRRM2 has a lower proximity score in the right patch than in the left patch.

(E) Visualization of THBS1, FBN2, and SRRM2 in the two patches shown in (A). The scatterplot shows the position of transcripts, and the edge indicates detected neighbors.

(F) Visualization of THBS1, FBN2, and SRRM2 in the two patches shown in (B).

(G) Distribution of proximity scores of THBS1-FBN2, THBS1-SRRM2, and FBN2-SRRM2 among all patches of fibroblast and U2-OS. The proximity scores in the fibroblast shown are higher than in the U2-OS cell shown in this figure for all three pairs of genes. p values: ns: 0.05 < p <= 1.00, ∗: 0.01 < p <= 0.05, ∗∗∗∗: p <= 0.0001
