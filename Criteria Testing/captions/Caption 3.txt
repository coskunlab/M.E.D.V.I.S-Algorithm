FIG. 3. Visualization and quantification of all retinal organoids and tissues.
Colored dots represent single cells in (A) retinal organoid and (B) tissue samples. Single cell phenotypes include rods (yellow), cones (purple),
BC (orange), MG (blue), RGC (green), HC (pink), and AC (red). In general, rods consist of the thickest layer and organoid layers are more
pronounced than their retinal counterparts. Imperfections in layered structure, observed in organoids and tissues, may arise from sectioning.
(C) Organoid and (D) tissue single cell patterns. The top graph quantifies the relative cell abundance of each phenotype. The bottom row
graph shows the relative distance to the elliptical fit for each cell. Single cell phenotypes are colored in the same manner as (A) and (B).
Overall, organoids possess a larger fraction of rods and MGs while tissues possess a larger fraction of rods and BCs. Organoids exhibit more
spatial variability due to their thicker layers than their tissue counterparts.
