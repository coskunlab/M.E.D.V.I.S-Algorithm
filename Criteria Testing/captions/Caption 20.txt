Single-cell analysis methods for organoids. (b) Schematic overview of widefield, confocal, light-sheet microscopy, and open-top light-sheet microscopy. Organoids are recovered from their 3D matrix, and the sample is fixed, blocked, and cleaned before immunolabeling with antibodies. The 3D rendering of images is performed with imaging analysis [139, 140]. (b) Schematic overview of scRNA-seq. scRNA-seq examines the individual cells to identify cell type and reveal cell differences via sequencing using Drop-seq [11, 141]. (c) Schematic overview of mass cytometry workflow. The organoids can be labeled with elemental isotopes staining. Mass cytometry allows cell-type identification and high-throughput characterization [17]. (d) Schematic overview of spatial barcoded assays. After labeling with a metal-based barcoding approach, the organoids are pooled for efficient embedding and cutting. Sections from the organoids can be imaged using IMC to study the spatial multiplexity, including the cell state, neighborhood, and global environment
