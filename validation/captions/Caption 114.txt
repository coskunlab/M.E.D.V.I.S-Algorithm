(A) We reanalyzed the DNA methylomes of 13 samples from (30) and used them for phylogenetic inference. The selected samples all belong to a single haplogroup, HPG1 (30, 31). (B) The phylogeny was inferred with the same epimutation clock regions that were used in MA1_1 and MA1_2. (C) We reanalyzed the published set of segregating SNPs to generate the phylogeny of North American accessions (30). (D) The number of substitutions per lineage (± SE). We removed Yng-53, a hybrid taxon (30, 32), and estimated the number of substitutions on the rest of the 12 lineages. (E) The coefficient of variation of depth suggests the SNP-based estimation has higher uncertainty than the estimation based on epimutation clock regions. (F) The estimated times between a modern taxon and the MRCA of 12 taxa. The error bars indicate 95% CI. All substitution rates of the epigenetic clock, which were calibrated from different data sources, indicate that the MRCA lived in 1864 ± 19 years. However, using four different published substitution rates of SNPs from (28, 32) shows that the MRCA lived between 1700 and 1840 (materials and methods). (G) Dating divergence event of 12 taxa with Bayesian tip calibration. We reanalyzed segregating SNPs from a total of 70 modern and 27 herbarium specimen samples from a previous study (32). In the phylogeny with all 97 samples, the MRCA of 12 taxa lived between 1769 and 1835 [95% high posterior density interval (HPD); mean: 202 years ago]. However, the phylogenies with only the 12 modern taxa and a part of herbarium specimen samples produced larger HPD intervals. The mean values of the time to the MRCA varied with the sample collection dates and substitution rates on the lineages. Outgroups OG1, OG2, and OG3 are specimens that were collected in the 19th century, 1900–1950, and 1950–1985, respectively. The outgroup includes six fast-evolving taxa, and the outgroup has an extra three slow-evolving taxa.
