(A) (Left) Representative flow plots showing the percentages of eosinophils in CD45+ cells in the SI of Nmur1+/+ dKO and Nmur1–/– dKO mice. (Right) Quantification (n = 8 to 9 mice per group). (B) (Left) Representative flow plots showing the percentages of eosinophils in CD45+ cells in the SI of eosinophilΔNmur1 and eosinophilWT mice. (Right) Quantification (n = 7 mice per group). (C) (Left) Representative images of eosinophils (Siglec-F+EPCAM–) in the SI of eosinophilΔnmur1 and eosinophilWT mice. Scale bars, 50 μm. (Right) Quantification of eosinophil densities (n = 17 to 23 images per group). (D) (Left) Representative flow plots showing the percentages of eosinophils in CD45+ cells in the SI of ΔdblGATA:Nmur1–/–chimeras and control chimeras. (Right) Quantification (n = 9 mice per group). (E) (Left) Representative flow plots showing the percentages of eosinophils in CD45+ cells in the SI of EpxCre/+Nmur1flox/flox mice and control mice. (Right) Quantification (n = 4 to 5 mice per group). (F) Representative electron micrographs of eosinophils isolated from the SI of eosinophilΔnmur1 (top) and eosinophilWT (bottom) mice at 24 hours after NMU injection. The boxed areas (Ei and Eii) are shown in higher magnification at the right. Red indicates emptying granules, blue indicates granules in the process of fusion, and green indicates intact granules. Scale bars, 2 μm (left) and 0.5 μm (right). (G and H) Quantification of the numbers of granules (G) or the frequencies of granules in each degranulation state (H) of cells from imaging shown in (F) (n = 64 cells from eosinophilWT mice and n = 45 cells from eosinophilΔnmur1 mice). Data are representative of two independent experiments (F) or are pooled from two [(B) to (E), (G), and (H)] or three (A) independent experiments, shown as means ± SEMs. Statistical significance was tested by two-tailed t test [(A) to (E), (G), and (H)].
