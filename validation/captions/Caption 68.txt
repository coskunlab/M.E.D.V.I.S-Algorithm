Chain lengthening involves CO insertion into O–H or O–R bonds of surface hydroxy or alkoxy, respectively (critical bonds are highlighted in red). Methane formation occurs through either an pathway via CHx hydrogenation or a  pathway involving hydrogenation of surface formate. Only the late pathway develops oscillatory behavior, as do higher hydrocarbons. Generally, the reaction scheme lumps together several elementary steps to enable the mathematical treatment. Water gas shift is an integral part of the scheme. Possible surface reconstructions (due to Co-to-Co2C or CeO2-to-Ce2O3 chemical transformations) have not been considered, in accordance with x-ray diffraction results shown in fig. S7. The details of this reaction scheme along with the kinetic approach can be found in the supplementary materials.
