(A) Controlled rotation of the remote qubit, conditional on the sensor qubit state being |0〉, obtained by driving the transition |0〉|0〉 ↔ |0〉|1〉 at fR = f3. Red points show coherent oscillations of the remote qubit detected through a sensing pulse at fS = f1, as shown schematically on the left. Red curve is a fit to an exponentially decaying sinusoid. The CNOT operation time is ~13 ns (dotted line). (B) Rate of controlled rotations, Ω/2π, of the remote qubit. The rate increased linearly with the RF voltage VR (upper) but remained unchanged as the tunnel current IDC (lower) was varied. Error bars are comparable with the size of symbols. Corresponding CNOT times are plotted on a second y axis on the right. Solid curves are linear fits. Inset illustrates the change of tip-sensor separations. (C and D) Controlled rotations of the sensor qubit without (C) and with (D) a CNOT operation at fR = f3 on the remote qubit. Blue (cyan) points measured with fS = f1 (f2) show sensor Rabi oscillations (solid lines are exponentially decaying sinusoidal fits) only when the remote qubit has a significant population in state |0〉 (|1〉). The CNOT operation transferred the predominant population from state |0〉|0〉 to state |0〉|1〉, thus causing the opposite trends of the oscillations between (C) and (D). Blue curves are shifted vertically by 50 fA for clarity. ESR conditions in (A): VDC = 50 mV, IDC = 10 pA, VS = 30mV, VR = 120 mV, τS = 200 ns; in (C): VDC = 20 mV, IDC = 7.5 pA, VS = 100 mV; and in (D): VDC = 20 mV, IDC = 7.5 pA, VS = VR = 100 mV. The sample was kept at 0.4 K during measurements.
