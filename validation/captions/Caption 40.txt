Sequencing the genomes of historical plants, as well as associated species, can address questions about their evolution and adaptation in response to anthropogenic pressures. Vertical bars indicate the intensity of human-mediated effects in the past five centuries (darker shades represent a stronger effect) on wild (left) and crop (right) plants. Stacks of herbarium specimens illustrate temporal sampling.
