(A) Composite stratigraphy, calibrated 14C ages, and sample numbers (in italics) of pollen and Ruppia seeds, as well as the minimum OSL age for sediments exposed in the trench at WHSA Locality 2. The calibrated 14C ages were used to construct the age models shown in Fig. 3. (B) Photograph looking south of the sediments exposed in the trench at WHSA Locality 2 along with locations of radiocarbon samples for Ruppia seeds (1a, 1b, and 1d) and pollen (1aa and 1dd) as well as the three OSL samples (OSL-1, -2, and -3) (22). Pollen sample 1ff is located near the base of the trench to the east (fig. S1). The large block cut out of the exposed face on the left side of the photograph was sampled previously for U-Th series disequilibrium dating (1).
