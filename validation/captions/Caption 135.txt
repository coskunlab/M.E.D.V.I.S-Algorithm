(A) Refractive indices of printed TiO2 NC films before and after ligand removal with nitrosyl tetrafluoroborate, and spin-coated films of pristine TiO2 NCs with native ligands. The solid curves represent the mean value and the shades represent error bars of refractive indices, respectively. (B) FTIR spectra of printed TiO2 films before and after ligand removal. (C) Compressive stress–strain curve. Fracture or failure of overall QD pillar is indicated by the red cross. (D) Dependence of compressive strength and elastic modulus of pillars on scan speed. (E) Stress–strain curves of pillars before and after sintering at 700°C. The numbers 1 to 4 correspond to different stages of deformation and failure, as monitored by (F) the snapshots during compression. The dashed line in the inset of (F) indicates the formation of shear band. (G) Compressive strength versus density Ashby plot of QD pillars in this work and other 3D printed pillars or lattices in previous reports (38–42). Scale bars, 1 μm. Error bars indicate standard deviations in (D).
