(A) The chlorophyll species and the presence or absence of CHLC orthologs in selected groups of photosynthetic eukaryotes and their plastid-less relatives (shown in gray fonts). Dinophyceae (nf), dinoflagellates that do not contain fucoxanthin; Och (Chr), Chrysista ochrophytes; Och (Dia), Diatomista ochrophytes. Chl c in this panel includes Chl c2, Chl c1, Chl c3, Chl cCS-170, and their esters with lipophilic molecules (18). Pigment compositions are displayed according to recent studies or reviews (6, 18). The three arrows indicate three endosymbiotic events that were mentioned in the text. (B) A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the CHLC family. The green-filled stars indicate PtCHLCs and functionally validated CHLC orthologs, whereas the gray-filled stars indicate proteins unable to generate Chl c based on in vitro assays (Fig. 3F and fig. S10). Please see the text for a discussion of outgroup selection. Symbio-LID refers to Symbiodiniaceae low-identity blast hits. Protein names are edited to include letters from the genus or species names. For the original IDs, see data S5.
