(A) Schematic demonstrating the ProCAR platform, in which synthetic CAR targets (Tags) are produced and released in situ by tumor-colonizing probiotic bacteria (E. coli Nissle 1917) to label ubiquitous components of solid tumors for de novo lysis by GFP-CARs (GFP28z). Tags are designed as dimers of sfGFP fused to an HBD (PlGF123–144) that broadly bind to cell surface and matrix proteins found in the TME. (B) Representative flow cytometry histograms demonstrating GFP28z surface expression through binding purified sfGFP (left) and coexpression of mScarlet (right) in primary human T cells. (C) Flow cytometric quantification of CD25 surface expression after exposure to 100 ng/ml of GFP-based CAR targets for 16 hours—monomeric sfGFP (GFP), soluble diGFP, collagen-bound GFP (Tag)—shown relative to MDA-MB-468 cells expressing mbGFP at a 1:1 ratio. Data represent mean ± SD of n = 3 biological replicates. MFI, mean fluorescence intensity. (D) Representative flow cytometry histograms of surface-bound GFP after incubation with 500 ng/ml Tag-GFP or diGFP for 20 min. (E) Confocal microscopy images of Jurkats expressing GFP28z-msScarlet fusion receptors for subcellular visualization. CARs are shown in orange and cocultured with unlabeled MDA-MB-468 target cells; images were acquired every 2 to 5 min after addition of 100 ng/ml of purified Tag. White arrows indicate CAR clusters. (F) Overnight killing assay against ffLuc+ HEK293T target cells at defined E:T ratios. CAR-T cells were cocultured with target cells ± 100 ng/ml of CAR targets for 20 hours. Specific lysis (%) was determined by normalizing relative light units (RLU) to cocultures with UT T cells. Data represent mean ± SD of n = 3 biological replicates. (G) Overnight killing assay of ffLuc+ HEK293T target cells at a 3:1 E:T with half log dilutions of purified Tag. Data represent mean ± SD of n = 3 biological replicates. (H) Overnight killing assays against a panel of ffLuc+ target cells at a fixed E:T ratio (3:1) and treated as in (F). (I) Overnight killing assay of ffLuc+ MDA-MB-468 in the presence of 20 ng/ml human HSPE (hHSPE) at a 1:1 E:T ratio, ± 100 ng/ml Tag. Data represent mean ± SD of n = 3 biological replicates. ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) [(C), (F), (H), and (I)] or one-way ANOVA (G), Holm–Sidak multiple comparison correction. ns, not significant; 468, MDA-MB-468.
