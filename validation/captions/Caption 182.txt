(A) Structural formulae of fluorinated BODIPY ps2, resorufin ps3, and resazurin ps4. (B) Changes in the absorption spectra of encapsulated E-4 in the presence of an equimolar amount of encapsulated sensitizer ps2 under yellow light (λmax = 561 nm; 2.5 mW ⋅cm–2). (C) DESC (here, for E-4) in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of ps2. (D) Changes in the absorption spectra of encapsulated E-1 in the presence of an equimolar quantity of encapsulated sensitizer ps3 under orange light (λmax = 599 nm; 0.8 mW ⋅cm–2). (E) DESC (here, for E-1) in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of ps3. (F) Changes in the absorption spectra of encapsulated E-2 in the presence of an equimolar quantity of encapsulated sensitizer ps4 under red light (λmax = 635 nm; 3.4 mW ⋅cm–2). (G) DESC (here, for E-2) in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of ps4. The data in (C), (E), and (G) were normalized to the 0 to 1 range, except for the experiments with no PS; raw data can be seen in figs. S85G, S93F, and S98G, respectively. norm., normalized.
