(A and B) Wild-type AR0382 adhesion in the presence of increasing concentrations of arginine (A) or 1 M additives (B). (C) Predictive model of the Scf1 N-terminal domain with two neighboring cationic-aromatic clusters highlighted. (D) Adhesion of wild-type AR0382, a mutant lacking SCF1, or AR0382 Δscf1 + SCF1-FLAG mutants encoding the wild-type SCF1 allele or alleles containing the indicated mutations. (E) Tetramethylrhodamine (TMR)–labeled 13–amino acid peptides corresponding to the wild-type Scf1 sequence (residues 50 to 62) or the same sequence with the indicated mutations incubated with the same polystyrene microspheres used to measure adhesion in (D). Scale bar, 5 μm. (F) Quantification (mean fluorescence intensity, MFI) of peptide binding to individual polystyrene microspheres as in (E) measured by TMR epifluorescence and corrected for background fluorescence. Each point represents an individual microsphere. Colored points represent averages of individual experiments used for statistical analysis. Statistical differences were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test [(A) and (B)] or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test [(D) and (F)]; *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001; ns: P > 0.05.
