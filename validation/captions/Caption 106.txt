. (A and B) Observed far-field
intensity (A) and S3 (B) distributions for a linearly polarized pump (10Pth). The intensity is fitted by
a radial Gaussian function with a FWHM Dk = 0.050k0, equal to the diffraction limit of 1.0l0/D (D being
the diameter of the core). (C) Observed emission spectra against pump power. The spectra (fitted
by bi-Lorentzian functions) are normalized by the pump power and shifted vertically for clarity.
(D) Measured power-dependent L-L curves and linewidths of the observed cavity resonance. Solid
curves are fitted by using the laser rate equations with different b-factors. The gray shadow indicates
the laser threshold Pth = 0.14 mW (17.8 W/cm2
). Inset shows the intensity evolution of lasing emission
and SE in a linear scale near Pth
