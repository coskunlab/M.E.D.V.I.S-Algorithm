(A) A schematic diagram of the model actuator used in our analysis. Em, Young’s modulus of the elastomer membrane; tm, membrane thickness; vm, Poisson’s ratio of membrane material; dm, membrane diameter; Tatm, atmospheric temperature; patm, atmospheric pressure; qin, gas flow rate into actuator; qout, flux out of actuator; pin, internal actuator pressure; Vin, internal volume of actuator; din and dout, diameters of the inlet and outlet ports, respectively; L, the length of the exhaust port; HT, heat-transfer coefficient. (B) The change in the concentration of reactant and product gases during actuation at f = 10 Hz as predicted by our model. (C) The internal pressure of our actuator during operation, modeled as a function of time. A magnified inset is provided for clarity. (D) The experimentally derived stroke-power and (E) continuous-power output of our actuator compared with our model predictions. A magnified image of the lowest equivalence ratios in (D) is shown in fig. S12.
