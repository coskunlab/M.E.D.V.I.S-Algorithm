Continuum-normalized spectra, smoothed with a five-point moving average, are shown by the solid black curves. The dashed black lines indicate the continuum level. The two band minima are marked by vertical blue and red dashed lines at 4.25 μm and 4.269 μm, respectively. (A) Spectrum extracted from a spatial pixel centered at 46°N, 87°W, in which the 4.27-μm peak dominates within the ν3 band. (B) Spectrum from a pixel centered at 15°N, 112°W, in which the 4.25-μm and 4.27-μm peaks have similar depths. (C) Spectrum from a pixel centered at 8°S, 84°W within Tara Regio, where the 4.25-μm peak is stronger than the 4.27-μm peak. The locations used for each panel are indicated in Fig. 2B.
