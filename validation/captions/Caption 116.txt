(A) Temperature records from marine sediments, marine carbonates, and terrestrial proxies from (17). Unweighted bootstrap resampling on these records with a bin width of 5000 years was performed 10,000 times on these data to create a trend line with an associated 2 standard deviation uncertainty (shown by shaded lines). (B) Carbon isotope dynamics from bulk carbonates [Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) site 1262 and ODP site U1403], which represent surface-ocean conditions, and benthic foraminifera (deep ocean), bootstrapped resampled 10,000 times using 5000-year time bins. C30n, C29r, and C29n refer to magnetic polarity chrons of the geomagnetic polarity time scale (GPTS). VPBD, Vienna Pee Dee belemnite.
