(A) SEM image of the hybrid pyramidal framework printed from CdSe/ZnS, PbS, In2O3, and TiO2 NCs. (B) Fluorescent  pattern composed of pixels of red- and blue-emitting QDs, displaying the merged magenta emission (left). The panels on the right were taken on the same image with selected color filters. (C) Heterogeneous printing of an shaped pin pattern. The N shape of red-emitting CdSe/ZnS QDs is drawn to connect some of the nine printed dots of TiO2. From left to right: Design, SEM, EDS mapping (Ti and Se), and fluorescent images of the pin pattern. Scale bars, 1 μm (A), 10 μm (B), and 5 μm (C).
