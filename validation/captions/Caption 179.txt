(A) The transformation of the stable E isomer of azobenzene to the metastable Z isomer traditionally relies on the use of ultraviolet (λ ≈ 350 nm) light. (B) The mechanism of DESC is as follows: (i) formation of the ternary inclusion complex (E⋅PS)⊂H (PS, photosensitizer; H, host); (ii) absorption of a photon of visible light by the PS followed by intersystem crossing (ISC); (iii) triplet-energy transfer (TET) and the formation of triplet azobenzene, followed by its relaxation (iv) to Z-azobenzene or (iv') back to E-azobenzene (corresponding to internal conversion); and (v) disassembly of the unstable (Z⋅PS)⊂H inclusion complex. (C) Components of the supramolecular system used for DESC include macrocyclic host H coassembled from six Pd2+ ions and four triimidazole ligands, and a photosensitizer (e.g., BODIPY ps1). (D) Structural formulae of azoarenes 1 to 9 investigated in this study.
