(A) The αKG/succinate ratio in YUMM1.7 cells treated with DMSO, 3-NPA, and 3-NPA + αKG for 6 hours (n = 4). (B) Immunoblot analysis of indicated lysine trimethylation marks on histone 3 in YUMM1.7 cells treated with DMSO, 3-NPA, and 3-NPA + αKG for 24 hours. Histone 3 and ACTIN are the loading controls. Numbers represents band density normalized to histone 3. Similar results were obtained with an independent experiment. (C) Cell surface MHC-I expression on YUMM1.7 cells treated with DMSO, 3-NPA, and 3-NPA + αKG for 48 hours (n = 6). MHC-I expression is presented as fold change relative to DMSO-treated cells. (D) Genome-wide distribution profiles of H3K4me3 (top) and H3K36me3 (bottom) binding based on ChIP-seq reads in YUMM1.7 cells treated with DMSO, 3-NPA, and 3-NPA + αKG for 24 hours. (E) Heatmap representation of H3K4me3 enrichment intensity based on ChIP-seq reads in YUMM1.7 cells treated with DMSO, 3-NPA, and 3-NPA + αKG for 24 hours. Signals within three kilobases of the transcription start site (TSS) are displayed in descending order for each cluster (i.e., gained, maintained, and lost in response to 3-NPA). (F) Heatmap representation of H3K36me3 enrichment intensity based on ChIP-seq reads in YUMM1.7 cells treated with DMSO, 3-NPA, and 3-NPA + αKG for 24 hours. Signals within two kilobases around the gene body [TSS to TES (transcription end site)] are displayed in descending order for each cluster (i.e., gained and maintained in response to 3-NPA treatment). (G) Volcano plots showing differentially enriched genes for H3K4me3 (top) and H3K36me3 (bottom) modifications from ChIP-seq data comparing DMSO- and 3-NPA–treated YUMM1.7 cells (P < 0.0001 and fold change > 1.25). Peaks enriched for MHC-APP genes are depicted in blue. (H) Bubble plot showing fold change of H3K4me3 enrichment on promoters of representative MHC-APP genes from ChIP-seq dataset comparing DMSO- and 3-NPA–treated YUMM1.7 cells. Color gradient depicts the log10 (P value). (I) Genome browser tracks for H3K4me3 marks at Nlrc5, Psmb9, Tap1, Psmb8, and Tap2 loci in ChIP-seq. Boxes indicate significantly enriched peaks (P < 0.0001 and fold change > 1.25) at sites of interest. (J) Genome browser track for H3K36me3 at Tap1 gene body in ChIP-seq. Box indicates significantly enriched peaks (P < 0.0001 and fold change > 1.25) at sites of interest. Data points in each panel represent an independent sample. Data are plotted as means ± SDs. Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test for (A) and (C).
