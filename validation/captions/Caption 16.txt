(A and B) Quantification of parasite numbers in the SI of ΔdblGATA:Nmur1–/– chimeras and controls (n = 11 mice per group) (A) and of EpxCre/+Nmur1flox/flox and control mice (n = 8 mice per group) (B) on day 7 after N. brasiliensis infection. (C) (Left) Representative periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) staining images of goblet cells in the SI of ΔdblGATA:Nmur1–/– chimeras and controls on day 7 after infection. Scale bars, 200 μm. (Right) Quantification (n = 4 mice per group). (D) (Left) Representative PAS staining images of goblet cells in the SI of ΔdblGATA:Nmur1–/–chimeras and controls under homeostasis. Scale bars, 200 μm. (Right) Quantification (n = 4 to 5 mice per group). (E) (Left) Representative images of goblet cells (EPCAM+MUC2+) in the SI of EpxCre/+Nmur1flox/flox and control mice. Scale bars, 50 μm. (Right) Quantification (n = 15 images per group). (F) Representative images of goblet cells (EPCAM+MUC2+) in the SI of Nmur1–/– dKO mice transferred with Nmur1+/+ or Nmur1–/– BMDEs (n = 10 to 15 images per group). Scale bars, 50 μm. (G) Quantification of goblet cell density in Nmur1+/+ dKO and Nmur1–/– dKO mice under homeostasis or treated as in (F) (n = 10 to 15 images per group). (H) (Left) Representative images of goblet cells (EPCAM+MUC2+) in the SI of mice carrying the inhibitory (hM4Di) or activating (hM3Dq) DREADD allele or control mice (NmuCre) treated with CNO for 7 days. Scale bars, 50 μm. (Right) Quantification (n = 10 to 14 images per group). (I) Representative images of SI organoids (EPCAM+DAPI+) cultured with the indicated conditions. Scale bars, 100 μm. EOS, eosinophils. (J) Quantification of the surface areas of organoids imaged in (I) (n = 28 to 44 organoids per group). (K) (Left) Representative PAS staining images of SI organoids. Scale bars, 50 μm. (Right) Quantification (n = 45 to 126 organoids per group). Data are representative of two (F) or three (I) independent experiments or are pooled from two [(B) to (E), (G), and (H)] or three [(A), (J), and (K)] independent experiments, shown as means ± SEMs. Statistical significance was tested by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test [(G), (H), (J), and (K)] or two-tailed t test [(A) to (E)].
