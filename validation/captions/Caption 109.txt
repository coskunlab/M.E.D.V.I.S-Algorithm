(A) Investigation of the effect of ligands on the yield of amination and on the change in Mn of the polymers. Amide incorporation (mol %) was determined relative to unmodified C2H4 units. Reaction yields were calculated as the percentage of amide that was incorporated. DTBP, di-tert-butyl peroxide. 1,2-DCB, 1,2-dichlorobenzene. (B) Comparison of aminations of polyethylene and n-hexane with L1 or L5 as ligand. Conditions: 1 equiv C2H4 units, 4 mol % benzamide, 0.1 mol % CuI, 0.1 mol % L1 or L5, 8 mol % DTBP, 1,2-DCB, 120Â°C. (C) Illustration of the range of amide incorporations accessible by this method. (D) Proposed mechanism for the catalytic amination of polyethylenes.
