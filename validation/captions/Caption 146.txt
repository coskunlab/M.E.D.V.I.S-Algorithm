(A) A false-color image of Europa as it appeared during the JWST observations (21). The image is oversampled at 0.031 arc sec per pixel; the diffraction-limited resolution is ~0.08 arc sec at these wavelengths. (B) Distribution of the band intensity of the CO2 2.7-μm feature, determined by fitting a model of CO2 crystalline ice to the spectrum at each location. The white circle indicates the size of Europa in (A). (C and D) The 4.25- and 4.27-μm double-peaked feature was modeled as a combination of two components: CO2 crystalline ice [band intensity shown in (C)] and CO2 noncrystalline ice [band intensity shown in (D)]. (B), (C), and (D) share the same color bar but with different maximum/middle values of 0.70/0.35, 4.20/2.10, and 7.10/3.55 nm, respectively.
