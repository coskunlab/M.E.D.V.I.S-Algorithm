(A) Photograph of the robot with component parts labeled. A schematic of the interior of the combustion chamber is also provided. Scale bar, 1 cm. (B) A transparent diagram of the robot, with the two independent combustion chambers highlighted in red. (C) Time-lapse image of our robot performing a 56-cm vertical leap. (D) Acceleration (black) and velocity (red) data of the robot body during takeoff at ϕ = 0.6 (square data points) and 0.4 (circular data points). The associated images outlined in red depict a takeoff experiment at ϕ = 0.60. Scale bar, 1 cm. (E) A schematic diagram of our idealized model robot leg. The variable definitions are the same as those in Fig. 2A, with the addition of mrob, mass of the robot body, and mleg, mass of the robot leg. (F) Modeled robot jumping height as a function of equivalence ratio for a series of actuation frequencies. Experimental data are depicted as solid circles (n = 5 robot tests; error bars, 1 SD), whereas a solid line denotes the height predicted by our model.
