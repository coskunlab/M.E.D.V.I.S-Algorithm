YUMM1.7-sgSCR (control) (n = 8), sgSdha (CII knockout) (n = 8), and sgNdufa1 (CI knockout) (n = 7) cells (2 × 105) were subcutaneously injected into the flanks of C57BL/6 male mice, and tumor growth was monitored for 20 days. (A to D) Tumor growth curves: tumor volume versus time (days postimplantation) (A), tumor weight (in grams at day 20) (B), number of tumor-infiltrating CD45+ cells per gram of tumor at day 20 (C), and CD8+ T cells per gram of tumor at day 20 (D). (E) Percentage of IFN-γ+ and GZMB+ positive tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in tumors at day 20. (F) Tumor surface MHC-I expression on cells from (A) at day 20. (G and H) Tumor growth curve (tumor volume versus time is plotted) (G) and tumor weight (in grams at day 21) (H) of tumors from sgSCR (control), sgSdha (CII knockout), sgSCR-sgB2m (control + β2 microglobulin knockout), and sgSdha-sgB2m (CII knockout + β2 microglobulin knockout) YUMM1.7 cells (2 × 105) subcutaneously implanted in C57BL/6 mice (n = 4). Data points in each panel represent independent samples from two experiments. Data are plotted as means ± SEMs. Statistical significance was determined by Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test for (A) to (H).
