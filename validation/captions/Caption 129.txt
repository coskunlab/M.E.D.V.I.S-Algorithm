(A) Representative images from the microbial attachment to hydrocarbons (MATH) assay. Hydrophobic cells are sequestered from the aqueous phase (Aq) to the aqueous-hydrocarbon interface (Int) after mixing with the hydrocarbon phase (HC). (B) Proportion of cells sequestered out of the aqueous phase during the MATH assay. (C and D) Cells were allowed to attach to a hydrophobic, untreated polystyrene surface (C) or a hydrophilic, vacuum plasma–treated polystyrene surface (D) for 1 hour. The surface was then washed and the proportion of cells that remained attached after washing was measured. Statistical differences were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test [(B), (C), and (D)] or Student’s t test [(C) and (D)]; *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001; ns: P > 0.05.
