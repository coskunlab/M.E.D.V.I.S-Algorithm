(A) Levels of OVA DNA specific to OVA:2W1S+ FMcs in each tissue of mice 30 days PP from primary pregnancy sired by OVA:2W1S+ H-2d BALB/c males treated with α-OVA IgG on days 2 and 16 after parturition (red) or rabbit IgG (blue), or virgin controls (black). (B) Percent FOXP3+ among CD4 cells with I-Ab:2W1S surrogate fetal specificity and numbers of I-Ab:2W1S+ CD4 cells in pooled secondary lymphoid organs for the mice described in (A). (C) Percent fetal wastage, average recoverable CFUs from concepti in each litter, and number of live pups per litter 5 days after maternal Lm infection midgestation (E11.5) for mice during primary pregnancy sired by OVA:2W1S+ H-2d BALB/c males (black), compared with during secondary pregnancy sired by OVA:2W1S+ H-2d BALB/c males in mice treated with rabbit IgG (blue) or anti-OVA IgG (red) PP on days 2 and 16 after primary pregnancy. (D) Percent FOXP3+ among CD4 cells with I-Ab:2W1S surrogate fetal specificity, number of I-Ab:2W1S+ FOXP3+ CD4 cells in pooled secondary lymphoid organs, and fold-expansion of these cells midgestation during primary pregnancy (black) or during secondary pregnancy in mice treated with rabbit IgG (blue) or α-OVA IgG (red). Each point indicates the data from an individual mouse and is representative of at least three independent experiments each with similar results. Bar, mean ± standard error.
