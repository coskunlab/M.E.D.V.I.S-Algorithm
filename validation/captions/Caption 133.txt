(A) SEM image of a portrait of Richard P. Feynman printed with red-emitting CdSe/ZnS core–shell QDs. (B) Red QDs are densely distributed in the printed structures while maintaining their sizes and shapes. (C) Printing linewidth as a function of scan speed and laser power. The error ranges were from measurements of SEM images. For the scan speed series, the laser power was set as 1 mW. For the laser power series, the scan speed was set as 4 μm/s. Inset shows the SEM image of the finest line. Error bars represent the standard deviation. (D to F) SEM images of (D) woodpile structures, (E) a bulging flower structure containing both linear and curved components, and (F) the model of Eiffel Tower. Insets in (E) and (F) show the top view. (G to I) SEM and fluorescent images of structures of different semiconductors printed by 3D Pin, including (G) tetrapods of CdSe/CdTe nanotetrapods (inset, TEM image of a single tetrapod), (H) pyramidal frameworks of CsPbBr3 NCs (inset, fluorescent image), and (I) pyramidal frameworks of InP NCs. (J to L) SEM images of 3D structures of metal oxides and metals, including (J) dodecahedra of TiO2 NCs, (K) helices of In2O3 NCs, and (L) helices of Au nanorods. All structures shown in this figure were printed from NC solution in toluene containing BTO, except that (L) was printed from Au nanorod solution in water containing DBTAI. Scale bars, 10 μm [(A) and (G) to (L)], 100 nm (B), 2 μm [(D) and inset in (E]), 5 μm [(E) and (F), and inset in (F)], 400 nm [inset in (C)], and 5 nm [inset in (G)].
