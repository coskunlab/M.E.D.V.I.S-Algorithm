(A to C) Testing pup-directed behavior in repeatedly pup-exposed pregnant females (Preg, n = 10) (A), pregnant females exposed to pups twice (Dual, n = 9) (B), and repeatedly pup-exposed ovariectomized females (OVX, n = 10) (C). Day of pregnancy [(A) and (B)] or relative to pairing with male (C) are shown. (D and F) Parental behaviors in Preg group. Within-group [Preg, virgin (Vir) versus each subsequent time point; red asterisks] and between-group (Preg versus OVX; black asterisks) comparisons are shown. (E and G) Comparison of Vir and D18 time points across groups. Note that virgins from Preg and Dual groups are pooled (fig. S1M). (H) Behavioral state transition diagrams for Vir and D18 females (Preg, n = 10). Average transition probabilities (PT) between behaviors are shown, and differences between Vir and D18 females are highlighted if P < 0.05 (U test; see materials and methods). retr., retrieval. (I) AAV-mediated ablation (KO) of Esr1 or PR in MPOA and control (ctrl). (J to L) Effects of MPOA-wide KO of Esr1 or PR on pup-directed behaviors (n = 7, 8, and 9 mice). (M) KO of Esr1 or PR in MPOAGal neurons. (N to P) Effects of MPOAGal-specific KO of Esr1 or PR on pup-directed behaviors (n = 8, 5, and 13 mice). Statistics by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis with log rank test in (D), (E), (J), and (N) and by Fisherâ€™s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment for multiple comparisons in (F), (G), (K), (L), (O), and (P). Shaded area in (D) is SEM. ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05.
