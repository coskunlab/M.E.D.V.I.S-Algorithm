In uninfected bystander cells, IFN-γ signaling induces expression of PIM1, which phosphorylates GBP1, subjecting it to sequestration by 14-3-3σ. This shunts aberrant GBP1 activity and ensures cell survival (left). Perturbation of this homeostasis leads to GBP1 dephosphorylation and Golgi targeting and disruption, culminating in necrosis (middle). Intracellular microbes that disrupt IFN-γ signaling, e.g., T. gondii, deplete PIM1 and liberate GBP1, which then attacks and controls the infection (right).
