(A) Outline of the proposed activation pathway of metal-free R2e, including the nonactivated state, catalytically active radical state, and radical-lost ground state (also known as in canonical R2). The two states determined in this work are indicated in green. The structure of R2e in the nonactivated state has been determined previously (13, 14). For clarity, chemical reactions are not strictly balanced. (B) Structure of MfR2 in the radical-lost ground state obtained after chemical quenching by hydroxyurea (monomer A is shown). (C) Structure of MfR2 in the radical state obtained from XFEL serial femtosecond crystallography showing a reorganization of the site compared with the ground state including a coupled movement of the DOPAY126-D88 dyad, the presence of a new water w1, and the inward conformation of K213. The short H-bond is highlighted in orange. (D) Superimposition of the ground and radical states. The 2-Å displacement of the DOPA para-O is marked in purple. Nitrogen and oxygen atoms are shown in blue and red, respectively. Carbons are shown in gray and cyan for the radical-lost ground state and radical state, respectively. Distance between atoms involved in H-bond interactions are in Å. Simulated annealing composite Omit 2Fo−Fc electron density maps are shown in green and contoured at 2 σ. The structural changes are further illustrated in movie S1. (E and F) Using quantum mechanical calculations on the XFEL structure, the short H-bond between DOPAY126 and D88 can be reproduced by a DOPA radical state with the radical mainly located on the para-O and the proton located on meta-O (E) (neutral DOPA radical state) or D88 (F) (negatively charged DOPA radical state). For clarity, only a subset of residues included in the calculations is presented on the figure (see fig. S3 for full details).
