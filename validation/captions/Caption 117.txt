Keeping every other input constant, in turn, these graphs show the relative impact of 5, 25, and 100 kyr pulses of the five LOSCAR input parameters on the three output values, surface δ13C (A to E), benthic δ13C (F to J), and atmospheric pCO2 (K to O). For each test, the model was spun up to steady state for 2 million years, at which time the pulse was applied, and the maximum deviation of the output parameter was recorded before the model returned to steady state after a further 2 million years. ppmv, parts per million by volume; Remin., remineralization.
