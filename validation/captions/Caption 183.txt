(A) Numbers in blue represent the composition of the PSS of azoarenes 1 to 9 subjected to DESC on the millimolar scale in the presence of 0.05 equiv. of the PS (ps2 under 561-nm light for 1 to 7; ps1 under 525-nm light for 8 and 9). Numbers in red represent the PSS compositions of the same azoarene–PS mixtures under identical illumination conditions, but in the absence of the host (CDCl3 was used as the solvent for all azoarenes except 3 and 5, for which CD3OD was used). Illumination times were 15, 12, 35, 12, 40, 24, 45, 4, and 9 min for 1 to 9, respectively. n.d., not detected (i.e., the amount of Z was below the NMR detection limit). (B) Evolution of absorption spectra during red-light irradiation of E-3 in water in the presence of 0.005 equiv. of (ps4)2⊂H. The resulting PSS contains 88% Z-3. (C) Selective switching of the negatively charged E-3 with 561-nm light in the presence of the positively charged E-5 on the micromolar scale. (D) UV-vis absorption spectra for the experiment shown in (C). Dotted line, PSS under 561-nm light; dashed line, PSS after the subsequent exposure to 365-nm light (where both azobenzenes isomerize to a similar extent). (E) Selective switching of E-4 with 561-nm light and (ps2)2⊂H in the presence of a UV-dimerizable anthracene. (F) UV-vis absorption spectra for the experiment shown in (E). Dotted line, PSS under 561-nm light; dashed line, after the subsequent exposure to 365-nm light.
