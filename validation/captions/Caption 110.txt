Amide incorporation (mol %) was determined relative to unmodified C2H4 units. DTBP, di-tert-butyl peroxide. 1,2-DCB, 1,2-dichlorobenzene. *Unless otherwise specified, starting PE was LDPE, Mn = 2.4 kg mol–1. †Reaction time of 2 hours. ‡Performed on a 3.0-gram scale. §Amide loadings of 2 mol %. ¶Conditions: 1 equiv TBSO groups, 1.5 equiv TBAF, tetrahydrofuran (THF), 75°C. #Conditions: 1 equiv CO2Me groups, excess LiOH, t-amyl alcohol, 90°C. **Conditions: 1 equiv BocNH groups, excess HCl, dichloromethane (DCM), 75°C.
