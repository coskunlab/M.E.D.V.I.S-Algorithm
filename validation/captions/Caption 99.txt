(A) Sequence of RNase B (124aa) with one N-linked glycan at Asn34. Imaging single unfolded RNase B molecules reveals the N-glycan position along the protein backbone and the N-glycan structure found on individual glycoproteoforms one molecule at a time, as shown in (B) for Man6GlcNAc2 and in (C) for Man5GlcNAc2. The position of Asn34 is estimated by a red dot along the protein backbone (white dashed line). Scale bar is 1 nm.
