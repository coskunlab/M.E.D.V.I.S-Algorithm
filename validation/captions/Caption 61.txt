Details of the steps from glutamate to DVP and the steps from monovinyl chlorophyllide a (MVC) to Chl a are skipped for simplicity. Carbon atoms 8, 171, and 172 and the five rings are labeled on DVP. Enzymes (shown as ovals) include CHLC (this study), divinyl reductase (DVR), and POR. Intermediates and cofactors include 2OG, DVC, DVP, MVC, and MVP. Shaded blocks indicate structural features generated by the corresponding enzymes (brown, CHLC; blue, POR; green, DVR). The circles in magenta highlight the protonation site absent in other chlorophylls. NADP+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; NADPH, reduced form of NADP+.
