(A) Levels of ovalbumin (OVA) DNA specific to OVA:2W1S+ MMcs or H-2k DNA specific to H-2k+ FMcs in each tissue among OVA:2W1S NIMA mice 21 days postpartum (PP) after allogeneic pregnancy sired by H-2k+ CBA males (red) or age-matched 12- to 14-week-old virgin OVA:2W1S-NIMA mice (blue). GEq, genome equivalents. (B) Representative plots and composite data showing FOXP3+ among CD4 cells with I-Ab:2W1S surrogate NIMA specificity and numbers of I-Ab:2W1S+ CD4 cells in pooled secondary lymphoid organs for the mice described in (A). (C) Percent fetal wastage, average recoverable colony-forming units (CFUs) from concepti in each litter, and numbers of live pups per litter 5 days after maternal Lm infection midgestation [embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5)] for naïve H-2b C57BL/6 mice during primary pregnancy sired by H-2d BALB/c males (black), compared with genetically identical H-2d NIMA mice undergoing primary pregnancy sired by H-2d BALB/c males (blue) or H-2d NIMA mice during secondary pregnancy by H-2d BALB/c males with prior pregnancy by H-2k CBA males (red). Each point indicates the data from an individual mouse and is representative of at least three independent experiments, each with similar results. Bar, mean ± standard error.
