(A) Probiotics are engineered to release an activating mutant of the human chemokine, CXCL16K42A, to recruit CXCR6+ ProCAR-T cells directly to the tumor site. (B) MDA-MB-468 cells (5 × 106) were subcutaneously implanted into the hind flank of NSG mice. Palpable tumors were then either injected with 1 × 105 CFU of a strain engineered to produce both CXCL16 and Tag in combination (ProCombo), control strains producing single agents (ProTag*, ProCXCL16), or a PBS control. On days 2 and 15 pbt, mice were intravenously treated with 6 × 106 GFP28z+ T cells. Mean tumor growth trajectories are shown. Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 3 biological replicates per group. (C) Counts of infiltrating hCD45+CD3+ cells per milligram of tumor. MDA-MB-468 tumors were established and treated as in (A). On day 7 after treatment, tumors from ProTag* and ProCombo treatment groups were retrieved and homogenized for analysis by flow cytometry. Data represent mean ± SEM of n = 4 biological replicates per group. (D and E) MDA-MB-468 tumors were established and measured as in (B). When tumors reached palpable size, mice were intravenously treated with 5 × 106 CFU of ProX strains or PBS. On days 3 and 17 pbt, mice were intravenously treated with 6 × 106 GFP28z+ ProCAR-T cells. Mean tumor trajectories are shown (E). Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 5 biological replicates per group. I.V., intravenously. (F to I) An orthotopic model of TNBC was established through the surgical implantation of 5 × 106 MDA-MB-468 cells into the mammary fat pad of female NSG mice. When tumor volumes reached ~100 mm3, mice were treated as in (D); mean tumor growth trajectories are shown (G). Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 6 biological replicates per group. (H and I) Biodistribution assessment of ProX (H) and sfGFP (I) in tumor, lung, kidney, spleen, and liver homogenates. On day 42 pbt, tumor and matched healthy tissue were digested and plated with the appropriate antibiotics for colony quantification or assessed by ELISA for sfGFP concentration. Data represent mean ± SEM of n = 5 (H) or n = 3 (I) biological replicates per group. Limit of detection (LOD), 200 CFU/g. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001; two-way or one-way (C) ANOVA, with Holm–Sidak multiple comparison correction.
