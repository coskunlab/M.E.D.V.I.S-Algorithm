(A) SEM and fluorescent images of dome structures of II–VI core–shell QDs emitting in red, green, and blue. (B) Corresponding PL spectra of printed QD structures. The spectra of spin-coated, pristine QD films are shown as dashed lines for reference. (C) SEM images of printed arrays of left- (LH) and right-handed (RH) nanohelices of red CdSe/ZnS semiconductor QDs. The diameter of the helices narrows with height, with a base diameter of ~2.4 μm. (D) Measured and simulated g-factor spectra of opposite-handed QD nanohelices. (E) 3D model of a single QD helix and its vertical cross-section slice and geometric parameters (rx1 = 139 nm, rx2 = 154 nm, dy = 656 nm) used for the simulation. Scale bars, 5 μm (A) and 2 μm (C).
