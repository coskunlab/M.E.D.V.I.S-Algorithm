(A) Whole-cell recordings from wild-type (top) and receptor-deleted (KO) (bottom) MPOAGal neurons. (B) Cumulative distribution of baseline firing frequency (Vir and D18; 33 and 21 cells from n = 15 and 7 mice). (C) Resting membrane potential of control and receptor-deleted MPOAGal neurons and recordings in presence of GIRK channel blocker Tertiapin-Q (Tert-Q) (38, 32, 15, 18, and 26 cells from n = 15, 9, 3, 3, and 5 mice). (D) Example current clamp recording traces of cells with (Vir) and without (D18) depolarization block. (E) Percentage of neurons exhibiting depolarization block (34, 30, 18, and 25 cells from n = 15, 8, 3, and 5 mice). (F) Example voltage clamp recording traces with sPSCs. (G) sPSC frequency (21, 23, 18, and 26 cells from n = 9, 6, 3, and 5 mice). (H and I) Excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) (Vir and D18; 31 and 30 cells from n = 5 and 4 mice) (H) and inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC) (31 and 28 cells from n = 5 and 4 mice) (I) frequency. (J) Dendritic segments of MPOAGal neurons with spines. (K) Spine density (14, 10, 8, and 15 cells from n = 10, 4, 3, and 4 mice). (L) Summary scheme for hormonal remodeling of MPOAGal neurons. Statsitics by U test in (B); one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Dunnett’s post hoc test in (C), (G), and (K); Fisher’s exact test with Benjamini-Hochberg adjustment in (E); and K-S test in (H) and (I). Scale bars, 20 μm (A) and 10 μm (J). ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05.
