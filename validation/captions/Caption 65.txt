(A to D) Self-sustained long-term oscillations of the temperature over a Co/Ce–oxide catalyst of Co2Ce1 atomic composition at 220°C, 1 bar total pressure, and a H2/CO ratio of 1/1. Oscillating temperatures (A) with periods of about 340 s and amplitudes of 7 Celsius degrees (for 16 hours) and 2 Celsius degrees (6 hours) (B) are observed along with a period in between and a short final dying-out. The harmonicity of the temperature oscillations is demonstrated in (C), and phases of temperature are related to those of the reactants and selected products after Fourier transformation in (D). Black and red dashed lines represent relative phases zero and π. C4 products show the same behavior.
