(A) Presynaptic numbers in an abdominal segment of C4da neurons at 2 days after egg laying (AEL) or 5 days AEL. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, the data, range except for outliers, and outliers. ****P < 0.0001, n.s. P ≥ 0.05, Mann-Whitney test. (B) Schematic images of preparations for calcium imaging in A08n neurons upon C4da activation. (C) Ca2+ imaging of A08n neurons upon C4da activation. (D) Time series for the average of Ca2+ responses in A08n neurons upon optogenetic activation of C4da neurons overexpressing wild-type or mutant Ube3a at the third instar larval stage. (E) Average of A08n maximal fluorescence increase (ΔFmax/F0) values upon optogenetic activation of C4da neurons overexpressing wild-type or mutant Ube3a. Data are expressed as the mean ± SEM. *P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test. (F) Experimental setup for local hot probe assay. (G) Latency of nociceptive rolling responses in the third instar larvae overexpressing wild-type or mutant Ube3a. (H) Presynaptic Ube3a activity is associated with abnormalities of the synaptic structures and functions.
