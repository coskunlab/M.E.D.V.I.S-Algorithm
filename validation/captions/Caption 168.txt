(A) Whole spinal cord visualization of projections from Vsx2 neurons in the lower thoracic spinal cord that project to walking execution centers. Insets illustrate the starter neurons labeled using intersectional viral tracing, and their projections in the lumbar spinal cord. (B) Vsx2 neurons with projections to walking execution centers express Zfhx3, a key marker of projection neuronal subpopulations. These neurons also express Gdnfr on the neuron soma as well as along the axon. (C) Overview of the experimental approach enabling anterograde viral tracing of ventral gigantocellular nuclei (vGi) neurons in both uninjured mice and mice that underwent natural repair. A 3D view of synapse-like contact of Vsx2 neurons in the lower thoracic spinal cord with vGi virally traced projections, indicated with the presynaptic marker, vGlut2.
