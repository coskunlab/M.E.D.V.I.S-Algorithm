(A) Subcellular locations of Ube3a-Flag (cyan) in peripheral compartments and the VNC in larval C4da neurons. (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) indicate the regions of dendrites, soma, axons, and presynapses, respectively. (B) Relative expression levels of Ube3a-Flag in each subcellular compartment of C4da neurons. Data are shown as the mean ± SEM. ****P < 0.0001, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparisons test. (C) Schematic images of preparations for time-lapse imaging of Ube3a::GFP in C4da axons. (D) Time-lapse images showing anterograde transport of Ube3a::GFP vesicles (red circles) in C4da axons. (E) Representative kymographs of the anterograde transport of Ube3a::GFP-positive vesicles within C4da axons. (F) Velocity of anterograde transport of Ube3a::GFP-positive vesicles. (G) Relative expression levels of Ube3a-Flag in axon terminals of khc-suppressed neurons. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, the data range except for outliers, and outliers. ****P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test. (H) Presynapse numbers in an abdominal segment at 24 hours APF. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and the data range. ****P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test. (I) A schematic image of axonal transport of Ube3a.
