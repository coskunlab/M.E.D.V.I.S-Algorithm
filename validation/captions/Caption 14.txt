(A) (Top) Schematic illustration of fate mapping of NMUR1-expressing SI eosinophils in Nmur1iCre-TdT;R26-GFP mice. (Bottom) Representative flow plots showing the distribution of GFP- and/or tdTomato-expressing cells in SI eosinophils in mice with the indicated genotypes (n = 3 mice per group). (B) Representative flow plots showing the percentages of EdU+ cells in NMUR1+ and NMUR1– SI eosinophils on days 3, 7, and 11 after EdU injection. (C) Quantification of EdU+ cell frequencies from (B) (n = 5 to 6 mice per group). (D) Quantification of the frequencies of CD45.2+ cells in total eosinophils (blue line) and the frequencies of NMUR1+ cells in CD45.2+ eosinophils (red line) at different time points after BM transfer (n = 4 mice per group). (E) Representative images of Siglec-F staining and NMUR1-TdT in the SI of Nmur1iCre-TdT mice in homeostasis or treated with IL-25 or N. brasiliensis. The individual boxed areas are shown in higher magnification at the right. Arrows indicate NMUR1+ Siglec-F+ eosinophils, and arrowheads indicate NMUR1+ nonhematopoietic cells. Scale bars, 50 μm. DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. (F) Quantification of the densities of NMUR1+ Siglec-F+ cells (n = 15 to 20 images per condition) from (E). (G) (Left) Representative flow plots showing the percentages of NMUR1+ SI eosinophils of Nmur1iCre-TdT mice treated with NMU-23 or vehicle. (Right) Quantification (n = 5 mice per group). (H) (Left) Representative flow plots showing the percentages of NMUR1+ cells in SI eosinophils of Nmur1iCre-TdT mice treated with DSS or pure water (PW). (Right) Quantification (n = 4 to 8 mice per group). Data are representative of three independent experiments [(A), (B), and (E)] or are pooled from three independent experiments [(C), (D), (F), (G), and (H)], shown as means ± SEMs. Statistical significance was tested by two-way (D) or one-way [(F) and (H)] ANOVA followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test or two-tailed t test [(C) and (G)].
