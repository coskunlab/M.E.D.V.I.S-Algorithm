(A) Schematic of the structural evolutions of MPD-ice and MPD-water and the Gibbs binding free energy (ΔGbinding) at TMPD-p=Tm by MD simulation. (B) The Eads of TMC with varying concentrations of MPD-ice at the n-hexane/ice interface. (C) MD simulations of the MPD diffusion coefficient at the initial reaction temperature for conventional IP (28°C) and IC-IP (–2.1°C). (D) ΔG for the MPD interaction with TMC from Tm to Ta by density functional theory (DFT). (E) X-ray diffraction (XRD) results of MPD-ice at different freezing times.
