(A) Spectrum from 2.5 to 5.2 μm (blue) expressed as spectral irradiance in janskys (Jy). Gray shaded regions indicate the ranges plotted in the other panels. Broad features due to H2O and CO2 ices are labeled. Narrower features are mostly Fraunhofer lines from sunlight reflected off Europa. (B) Zoomed spectrum (black histogram) around the band of crystalline CO2 ice at 2.7 μm, normalized by the local continuum. The green line shows a solar spectrum used to identify the Fraunhofer lines. The dark purple line is a model of crystalline CO2 ice; the light-purple shading indicates the integrated band strength used to produce the map in Fig. 2B. (C) Same as (B) except for the double-peaked CO2 feature at 4.27 μm. The blue line is a model of a CO2:H2O:CH3OH [1:0.8:0.9] mixture at 114 K. The shape of the observed spectrum is fitted with a combination of the blue and purple models. The peak position and width of the feature can alternatively be reproduced with a model (dashed red line) of carbonic acid synthesized in a CO2:H2O ice mixture (ratio 5:1) exposed to ionizing radiation.
