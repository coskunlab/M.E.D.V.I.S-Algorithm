(A) Schematic views of wild-type and mutant Ube3a::GFP used in this study. (B and C) Relative expression levels of Ube3a::GFP with a domain deletion or an Angelman syndrome missense mutation in the (B) axon terminals and (C) soma. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and the data range. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, n.s. P ≥ 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. (D) Colocalization of Ube3a-Flag (wild-type or D313V) and Khc::GFP in C4da axons. Arrowheads indicate Ube3a-Flag (magenta) and Khc::GFP (green)–double-positive vesicles. (E) Percentages of Ube3a-Flag (wild-type or D313V) and Khc::GFP–double-positive vesicles. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and the data range. ****P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test. (F) Presynapse numbers in an abdominal segment. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and the data range. ****P < 0.0001, *P < 0.05, n.s. P ≥ 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test.
