(A) Adhesion of wild-type AR0382 or mutants lacking one of 12 genes from the ALS or IFF/HYR adhesin families. (B) The 2560 insertional mutants in the AR0382 strain background were screened for adhesion defects by measuring the proportion of cells able to remain attached to a cyclic olefin polymer surface after three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Strains are ordered by Z-score rank. Mutants with a Z-score more negative than –3 were considered to have a significant adhesive defect. (C) Adhesion of AR0382 and an insertional SWI1 mutant. (D) RNA sequencing comparing the transcriptome of tnSWI1 with that of AR0382. SCF1 (B9J08_001458) is the strongest dysregulated gene. (E) Predicted domain architecture of Scf1 based on the clade I primary sequence is consistent with canonical fungal adhesins. (F) Adhesion of adhesin mutants and complements compared with AR0382. (G) Immunofluorescence microscopy using an α-FLAG antibody. Representative images shown for wild-type AR0382 and AR0382 Δscf1 + SCF1-FLAG. Scale bar, 5 μm. Statistical differences were assessed using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post hoc test (A), Student’s t test (C), or one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s post hoc test (F); *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001; ns: P > 0.05.
