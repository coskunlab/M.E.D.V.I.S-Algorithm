NMR yields were determined by 19F NMR integration using fluorobenzene as an internal standard. See supplementary materials for experimental details. (A) Percentage of VDF delivered to solution (determined by 19F NMR) from freshly prepared VDF-Mg2(dobdc) or wax-encapsulated VDF-Mg2(dobdc). Ph, phenyl. (B) Scope of Pd-catalyzed defluorinative coupling of VDF and (hetero)arylboronic acids using VDF-Mg2(dobdc). 19F NMR yields are given with isolated yields shown in parentheses. For the reactions corresponding to the yields in the first row, VDF-Mg2(dobdc) was freshly prepared and dispensed using a solid-addition funnel. For the reactions corresponding to the yields in the second row, VDF-Mg2(dobdc) wax capsules were stored on the benchtop for 24 hours before they were broken to dispense VDF-Mg2(dobdc). R, functional group. (C) Pd-catalyzed defluorinative coupling of HFP and arylboronic acids using HFP-Mg2(dobdc). (D) Performance of VDF-Mg2(dobdc) in defluorinative coupling with 4-biphenylboronic acid after storage under different conditions. An asterisk indicates that the wax capsule was cut open before dispensing VDF-Mg2(dobdc); a dash indicates not determined.
