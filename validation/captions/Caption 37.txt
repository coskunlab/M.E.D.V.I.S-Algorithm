(A) The integrity of megabase length DNA is maintained by a cell's enzymatic repair machinery and, in eukaryotic genomes, packaged in histone-DNA complexes. (B) Following death, repair stops and DNA damage begins to accumulate. Nucleases and microorganisms cleave DNA in labile regions between nucleosomes and when the DNA backbone faces away from histones. (C) Over time, chemical damage also accumulates. Cytosine bases are converted to uracil and methylated cytosines are converted to thymines (by deamination). Cytosines are particularly vulnerable to deamination in single-stranded regions such as in overhanging regions at DNA termini, but deamination is possible in some double-stranded contexts. Fragmentation occurs after the loss of purine bases (depurination), creating abasic sites that can be cleaved by β elimination. Depurination and β elimination create a region of single-stranded DNA, which leaves cytosines vulnerable to deamination.. (D) Given enough time, DNA molecules will become too short to be identifiable. (E) A summary of base and mismatch frequencies along the initial 15 5’ and 3’ bases of reads generated using a single-stranded DNA library protocol. Depurination leads to overrepresentation of adenine and guanine bases adjacent to strand breaks. C-to-T mismatches are elevated near read ends and observed throughout damaged reads. While 3’ G-to-A mismatches are observed in double-stranded libraries, single-stranded libraries show a C-to-T signal at both ends by retaining the native termini of the molecules.
