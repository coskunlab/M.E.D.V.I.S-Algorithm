(A) Tunneling spectra versus VB of TDBG at selected displacement fields taken from the map in (B). Tunneling spectral map in the D versus VB plane at (B) B = 4 T. (C) Corresponding theory map for B = 4 T (quantum calculation). (D) Tunneling spectral map in the D versus VB plane at B = 8 T. (E) Corresponding theory map for B = 8 T (quantum calculation) (42). The maps in (B) and (D) were acquired on the maxima positions in the moir√© structure indicated by the red dot in Fig. 1D. Setpoints: I = 20 pA, VB = 120 mV for (B) and (D), T = 0.01 K. See figs. S11 to S13 for additional spectral map data.
