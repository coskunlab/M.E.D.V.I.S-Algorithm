(A) Schematic of experiment outlining administration of tamoxifen to induce Cre-mediated recombination and harvesting of heart at 10 days after MI. (B and C) Immunofluorescent staining of heart of CF-ChR2 animal harvested at 10 days after MI that demonstrates cardiomyocyte (red, Troponin I) and ChR2-expressing cells (green, eYFP) in uninjured myocardium remote to scar tissue (B) and scar tissue (C). Merged image and magnified inset demonstrating spatial relationship of fibroblasts (arrows) to myocytes. Scale bar, 20 μm. (D) Immunostaining for vimentin (red) and ChR2 (green) that demonstrates colocalization of ChR2 in vimentin-expressing cells (merged image and magnified inset [arrows, yellow]). (E to G) (E) Schematic of optical stimulation of scar tissue of the perfused heart before (F) and at the onset of (G) optical stimulation with blue light. (H) Cardiac electrical recording before, during, and after optical stimulation of scar tissue at 7 Hz (blue lines indicate pulses of optical stimulation, bpm: recorded cardiac electrical activity in beats per minute). (I to K) Magnified atrial (black arrows) and ventricular electrograms (blue arrows) from recordings before (I), during (J), and after (K) optical stimulation. Note the dissociation of atrial and ventricular rhythm during stimulation with atrial activation not preceding ventricular activation. (L) Cardiac electrical recording after optical stimulation of scar at 9 Hz. (M and N) Cardiac electric recording after stimulation of myocardium remote to scar tissue in CF-ChR2 animal (M) or scar in Cre (−) animal (N). Representative tracings shown; n = 20 Cre (+) scar, n = 6 Cre (−) scar, and n = 10 Cre (+) remote.
