(A) Structure of MfR2 in the radical-lost ground state obtained after chemical-quenching by hydroxyurea. (B) Structure of MfR2 in the radical state obtained from XFEL serial femtosecond data showing reorganization of the site compared with the radical-lost ground state, including conformational changes of Q91, L183, and F187. In the radical state, Q91 displaces two water molecules, breaking the water H-bond network toward DOPAY126. Structural movements of L183 and F187 leave space for 3 water molecules interacting with D88, DOPAY126, and K213. Simulated annealing composite Omit 2Fo−Fc electron density maps are shown in green and contoured at 1.5 σ. (C) Superimposition of the structures of MfR2 in the radical state (cyan) and radical-lost ground state (gray).
