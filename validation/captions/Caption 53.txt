Spectral maps in the B versus VB plane for displacement fields of (A) D = 0.35 V nm–1, (B) D = –0.05 V nm–1, and (C) D = –0.1 V nm–1 showing the dispersion of the electron and hole-pocket LLs with magnetic field, and the shift of the V1 saddle point to lower energies with increasing displacement field. (D) Tunneling spectra versus VB of TDBG as a function of magnetic field at fixed D = –0.05 V nm–1. (E) LL peak positions versus B for D = –0.05 V nm–1. Data from LLs n = 0 to n = 8 are shown. Symbols, experimental peak positions; solid lines, cubic-spline interpolation of experimental peak positions. (F) S(E) computed from the solid lines in (E) with Eq. 1. The lack of data collapse indicates that second-order contributions to the LL energies are substantial.
