(A) t-SNE visualization of eosinophil transcriptome profiles in different tissues (n = 3 to 4 mice per group). (B) The relative expression [row-wise Z-score of log2 (TPM + 1)] of genes across different tissues, as indicated (top). TPM, transcripts per million. Representative genes are shown (right). (C) Two-dimensional plot showing expression fold change in SI relative to other tissues (x axis) versus entropy score (y axis). Dot size and color represent relative expression and associated significance, respectively. (D) Quantification of Nmur1 transcript abundance by qPCR in eosinophils from indicated tissues (n = 4 to 8 mice per tissue). (E) UMAP visualization of SI eosinophil profiles, colored by cluster. (F) UMAP plots, as in (E), showing relative expression of Nmur1. (G) (Top) Nmur1iCre-TdT mouse design. (Bottom) Representative flow plots showing tdTomato+ SI eosinophil percentages in wild-type (WT) and Nmur1iCre-TdT mice. (H) Quantification of tdTomato+ eosinophils in indicated tissues of Nmur1iCre-TdT mice (n = 3 to 6 mice per tissue). (I and J) Representative flow plots (I) and quantification (J) showing NMUR1+ eosinophil percentages in human tissues. n = 4 to 6 donors per tissue were used for quantification. (K) (Top) Representative histograms showing CD63 abundance in SI eosinophils measured by flow cytometry. (Bottom) Quantification. MFI, mean fluorescence intensity (n = 4 mice per group). (L) Representative electron micrographs of NMUR1+ (n = 43) and NMUR1– (n = 32) SI eosinophils. The boxed areas (Ei and Eii) are shown at higher magnification below. Red indicates emptying granules, blue indicates granules in the process of fusion, and green indicates intact granules. Scale bars, 2 μm (top) and 0.5 μm (bottom). (M and N) Quantification of granule numbers (M) or frequencies of granules in each degranulation state (N) in EM imaging (L) of NMUR1+ (n = 43) and NMUR1– (n = 32) cells. Data are representative of three [(G) and (L)] or four (I) independent experiments or are pooled from three [(D), (H), (K), (M), and (N)] or four (J) independent experiments, shown as means ± SEMs. Statistical significance was tested by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s multiple comparisons test [(D), (H), and (J)] or two-tailed t test [(K), (M), and (N)].
