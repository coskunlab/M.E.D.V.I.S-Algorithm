(A) Scheme of the presynaptic compartment. AZ, active zone; Cav, voltage-sensitive calcium channel; nCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; PSD, postsynaptic density; SV, synaptic vesicle. (B and C) Kymographs showing the trafficking of endogenous SYPendo-eGFP with VAMP2-SNAP (B) or MUNC13-1–SNAP (C). The x axis is 30 μm; the y axis is 1 min. Vertical lines indicate static foci. Scale bar, 10 μm. (D) Fraction of anterogradely moving SYPendo-eGFP vesicles cotrafficking with SYP-SNAP (87.3 ± 3.2%), VAMP2-SNAP (87.1 ± 4.3%), and MUNC13-1–SNAP (88.4 ± 7.0%). n = 4 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). (E) Number of anterogradely trafficking SYPendo-eGFP vesicles (per min per 30-μm length) in proximal axons of iNs on days 12 to 13 after 24-hour incubation with DMSO, cycloheximide (CHX), or anisomycin: DMSO, 11.5 ± 1.3; CHX, 2.2 ± 0.2; anisomycin, 2.1 ± 0.1. n = 3 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed; **p < 0.01. (F) Fraction of anterogradely moving vesicles colabeled for SYP-mRFP and SYP-eGFP (92.8 ± 2.6%), vGlut1-venus (89.6 ± 3.3%), eGFP-Bassoon (79.2 ± 7.5%), MUNC13-1-eGFP (82.7 ± 5.9%), Neurexin1β-eGFP (83.4 ± 3.4%), and Mito-Halo (6.5 ± 1.8%) in proximal axons of mouse hippocampal neurons. n = 3 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). (G) Kymographs illustrating cotrafficking of endogenous SYPendo-eGFP with ARL8B-iRFP in iN. The x axis is 30 μm; the y axis is 1 min. Vertical lines indicate static foci. Scale bars, 10 μm. (H) Fraction of anterogradely moving SYPendo-eGFP vesicles colabeled for LAMP1-mRFP (61.0 ± 10.4%) or ARL8B-iRFP (56.3 ± 6.3%). n = 5 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). (I) Fraction of anterogradely moving LAMP1endo-eGFP vesicles colabeled for SYP-mRFP (44.0 ± 6.4%) or Syt1-mRFP (62.9 ± 8.9%). n = 4 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). (J) Three-dimensional reconstruction of PVs (green) recruited to mitochondrion (red). Scale bar, 500 nm. (K) Ultrastructure of PVs recruited to mitochondria analyzed by FIB-SEM. Asterisks mark vesicles. Scale bars, 100 nm. (L) Cumulative plot of diameters of PVs and SVs. (M) Violin plot of the distribution of PV sizes. Whiskers show the minimum and maximum, box borders indicate first and third quartiles, and the line indicates the median. Data are mean ± SEM.
