(A) The MA lines shared a common ancestor and were maintained by single-seed descent for 3, 31, and 32 generations (G3, G31, and G32). Their DNA methylomes were sequenced by Becker et al. (14) (MA1_1, green dots) and Schmitz et al. (13) (MA1_2, blue dots) separately. In addition, Ossowski et al. (28) sequenced the genomes of five G30 individuals from 29, 49, 59, 69, and 119 (orange). (B) We inferred the phylogeny of these MA lines using our epimutation clock. The inferred topology recapitulates the known evolutionary relationships among the sequenced samples. The G32 individuals are marked with a red asterisk. (C) We estimated the number of accumulated substitutions on each lineage from the phylogeny (i.e., depth of tip node; materials and methods). The error bars represent the SE of accumulated substitutions per lineage. The average depth of G31 individuals is consistent with the clocklike accumulation of epimutations in the different MA lineages. For comparison, the number of SNPs per G30 lineage from the previous study (28) is also shown. (D) The CV of the estimated substitution rate. The CV of the substitution rate from segregating SNPs is significantly higher than the CV of the substitution rate from the epimutation clock. (E) With the estimated substitution rates, we inferred the time to the MRCA. The error bars show 95% CI. The blue line indicates 31 generations. The red dashed line indicates 30 generations. The epimutation clock not only estimates the correct time to the MRCA but also shows higher consistency than the times estimated with segregating SNPs. The SNP-1 is the mean of SNP substitution rates that was calibrated from the SNP phylogeny of the MA lines. SNP-2, SNP-3, and SNP-4 are three published estimates of SNP substitution rates (28, 32).
