(A) Western blot demonstrating expression of Cx43 in wild-type (WT) CFs, CF-ChR2 (Cx43fl/fl) CFs, and after transfection of Cx43fl/fl CFs with Cre plasmid to generate Cx43KO CFs. (B) Schematic of optical stimulation of CF-ChR2 cocultured with NRVMs loaded with x-Rhod-AM dye to record calcium transients. (C to E) Recording of calcium transients in cardiomyocytes after optical stimulation of CF-ChR2 (C), Cx43KO-CF-ChR2 (D), and Cx40/43/45/Panx1KO-CF-ChR2 (E) fibroblasts (blue bars represent optical stimulation pulses). Representative tracings, n = 5 per group. (F to K) Modeling of GJ (F) and non-GJ (ephaptic) (G) coupling, with simulation demonstrating successful depolarization of fibroblasts (Vfibro) and myocytes (Vmyo) with either GJ (H) or non-GJ (I) coupling. Blue bars indicate pulses of optical stimulation applied to fibroblasts. (H and I, insets) Differences in membrane depolarization of fibroblast and myocyte with GJ and non-GJ coupling. (J) Simulation showing myocyte excitation with variation in GJ and ephaptic coupling (vcl). Ten fibroblasts were connected to the myocyte for this simulation. The red box represents low GJ conductance but strong ephaptic coupling, and the blue box represents strong GJ conductance with weak ephaptic coupling. The purple box indicates where ephaptic and GJ coupling synergize to excite myocytes. (K) Simulation showing myocyte excitation with variation in Na+ channel conductance of CFs and the number of CFs coupled to the myocyte solely through ephaptic coupling. In (J) and (K), colored circles represent successful myocyte excitation, and dots represent unsuccessful myocyte excitation. Color of the circles represents delay (time interval) to myocyte excitation tint (milliseconds).
