(A) Representative confocal images of WT iNs, ARL8A/B double-KO iNs, and double-KO iNs expressing ARL8B–c-myc at day 30 that were immunostained for presynaptic Bassoon (BSN), postsynaptic Homer1, and MAP2. Scale bar, 5 μm. (B) Number of synapses and number of pre- and postsynaptic puncta per 20-μm dendrite length. n = 3 experiments (≥50 puncta each). (C and D) Representative confocal images of WT iNs, ARL8A/B double-KO iNs, and double-KO iNs expressing ARL8B–c-myc at day 30 immunostained for Synaptophysin (C), Bassoon (D), and Homer1 [(C) and (D)]. Scale bars, 10 μm. (E to H) Quantified mean fluorescence intensity of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in WT iNs, ARL8A/B double-KO iNs, and double-KO iNs expressing ARL8B–c-myc (day 30). n = 3 experiments (≥100 synapses each). Shown are Synaptophysin (SYP) (E), Bassoon (F), Cav2.1 (G), and Homer1 (H). (I) Number of synapses and of pre- and postsynaptic puncta per 20-μm dendrite length in WT iNs, KIF1A KO iNs, and KO iNs expressing KIF1A (day 30). n = 3 experiments (≥50 puncta each). (J to M) Quantified mean fluorescence intensity of pre- and postsynaptic proteins in WT iNs, KIF1A KO iNs, and KO iNs expressing KIF1A (day 30). See (E) to (H) for abbreviations. n = 3 experiments (≥100 synaptic puncta each). (N) Defective presynaptic biogenesis in absence of Unc104-mediated PV delivery in D. melanogaster. Reduced amounts of VGLUT at Unc104 mutant NMJs. WT, 100 ± 11; Unc104, 6.3 ± 0.8. n = 10 (WT) and 10 (Unc104) NMJs. t test was performed. (O) Schematic representation of pre- and postsynaptic calcium sensors SYP-CGaMP6f and Xph20-CGaMP7f. (P) Mean normalized fluorescence (ΔF/F0) response of Xph20-CGaMP7f to 100–action potential (10 Hz, 10 s) stimulation in WT, ARL8A/B double-KO, and KIF1A KO iNs. a.u, arbitrary units; AUC, area under the curve. Data were normalized to prestimulation. n = 3 independent experiments. In (B), (E) to (M), and (P), one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed. For all graphs, ****p < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and ns is p > 0.05. Data are mean ± SEM.
