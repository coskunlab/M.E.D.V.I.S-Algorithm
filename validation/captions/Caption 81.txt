(A) Proposed catalytic cycle of cobalt photocatalyzed C(sp2)–N coupling of aryl amide and aryl boronic acids. (B) Evidence of the intermediacy of an N-centered amidyl radical species. (C) Probing the intermediacy of an aryl radical species. (D) Stern-Volmer plot of bimolecular quenching kinetics between [Co(4,4′-Br2bpy)3](PF6)3 and acetanilide as determined with time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The data represents the average of two replicate measuremnts and were fit to a simple linear regression.
