(A) A schematic view of dendrite arborizations and axonal projections of C4da neurons in third instar larvae. (Bottom) Axon terminal projections (green) and presynapses (magenta) in the ventral nerve cord (VNC). (B) The number of presynaptic marker puncta in the abdominal segments of C4da neurons from third instar larval stage to 24 hours APF. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, the data range except for outliers, and outliers. (Bottom) Presynapses (magenta) and axon terminals (green) of C4da neurons. (C) A schematic view of presynapse elimination and dendrite pruning in C4da neurons during metamorphosis.
