After 10 separate runs of the parallel MCMC algorithm, the mean outputs of temperature deviation from late-Cretaceous values (A) and surface (B) and benthic (C) Î´13C were recorded for 10,000 sets of input parameters post-convergence, and their associated 95% credible interval was calculated. They are compared with the proxy and observed data from Fig. 1, spanning 2 million years, from 67 to 65 Ma.
