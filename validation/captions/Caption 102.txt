(A) Kymographs of trajectories of SYP-eGFP vesicles in WT or ARL8A/B double-KO iNs. The x axis is 30 μm; the y axis is 1 min. Scale bar, 10 μm. DKO, double KO. (B) Number of anterogradely moving SYP-eGFP vesicles (per min per 30-μm length): WT, 9.2 ± 0.6; WT + ARL8B-Myc, 8.7 ± 1.4; ARL8A/B double KO, 2.6 ± 0.9; ARL8A/B double KO + ARL8B-Myc, 7.9 ± 1.7. n = 3 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed (C) Scatterplot of ARL8B-mCherry interacting proteins in iNs. Blue, lysosomal proteins; green, kinesins; orange, SV proteins. LFQ, label-free quantification. (D) Coimmunoprecipitation of ARL8B-mCherry with KIF1A-eGFP in developing iNs. Bound proteins were detected by immunoblotting. Total lysate blots represent 5% of material used as input for coimmunoprecipitation. IP, immunoprecipitate. (E) Kymographs illustrating cotrafficking of KIF1A-eGFP with SYP-mRFP (top) or ARL8B-mCherry (bottom) in iNs. The x axis is 30 μm; the y axis is 1 min. Scale bars, 10 μm. (F) Fraction of anterogradely moving SYP-mRFP (76.9 ± 6.5%), MUNC13-1-SNAP (79.7 ± 5.9%), or ARL8B-mCherry (64.1 ± 10.1%) puncta cotrafficking with KIF1A-eGFP. n = 5 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). (G) Kymographs of trajectories of SYP-eGFP vesicles in iNs that are WT, KIF1A KO, or KO expressing full-length KIF1A (KIF1A-FL) or Rigor mutant KIF1A. The x axis is 30 μm; the y axis is 1 min. Scale bar, 10 μm. (H) Number of anterogradely moving, retrogradely moving, or stationary SYP-eGFP vesicles (per min per 30-μm length): WT, 9.7 ± 1.7; KIF1A KO, 2.4 ± 0.5; KO + KIF1A-FL, 8.7 ± 0.3; KO + KIF1A-rigor, 2.4 ± 0.3. n = 3 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). One-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed. (I) Kymographs showing trajectories of SYP-mRFP vesicles in primary mouse hippocampal neurons expressing full-length KIF1A or Rigor mutant KIF1A. Scale bar, 10 μm. (J) Number of anterogradely moving SYP-mRFP vesicles (per min per 30-μm length) in mouse hippocampal neurons: KIF1A-FL, 8.1 ± 1.1; KIF1A-Rigor, 2.5 ± 0.8. n = 3 experiments (≥50 synaptic puncta each). t test was performed. For all graphs, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and ns is P > 0.05. Data are mean ± SEM.
