(A) Motility of SYP-mRFP vesicles in WT and ARL8A/B double-KO iNs transduced with control lentivirus (shCTRL) or after lentiviral knockdown of Myrlysin, Diaskedin, or PIKFYVE. n = 3 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). (B) PI(3,5)P2 measured by quantitative ratiometric imaging in situ: WT, 0.05 ± 0.004; shMyrlysin, 0.15 ± 0.01. t test was performed. (C) Depletion of PI(3)P or PI(3,5)P2 inhibits anterograde transport of SYPendo-eGFP vesicles in iNs. Number of SYPendo-eGFP vesicles (per min per 30-μm length) moving anterogradely, retrogradely, or remaining stationary per minute in iNs treated (30 min) with DMSO, VPS34-IN1, or Apilimod. DMSO, 11.1 ± 2.2; VPS34-IN1, 1.7 ± 0.9; Apilimod, 3.6 ± 1.1. n = 5 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). (D) Number of anterogradely moving SYP-eGFP vesicles in day 12 to 14 iNs (per min per 30-μm length): WT, 8.5 ± 0.9; PIKFYVE KO 1, 3.8 ± 0.05; PIKFYVE KO 2, 2.5 ± 0.4; PIKFYVE KO 3, 4.3 ± 0.2. n = 3 experiments (≥50 vesicles each). (E) 2xPH-(KIF1A) associates with PI(3,5)P2 liposomes. Bound fraction (percentage of total): no liposomes, 1.7 ± 0.6%; no PI, 5.5 ± 2.0%; PI(3,5)P2, 60.9 ± 4.0%; PI(4,5)P2, 12.9 ± 5.5%; PI(3)P, 24.0 ± 8.1%. n = 4 experiments. In (A) and (C) to (E), one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post hoc test was performed. (F) Colocalization of endogenous mCherry-PIKFYVE with VAMP2 or SYT1 (green) in iN axons. Scale bar, 10 μm. Show at the bottom are line intensity scans from 10-μm segments. (G) Representative confocal images of iN axons expressing SYP-mRFP and microinjected with the PI(3,5)P2-sensing fluorophore-labeled ep85α-cSH2 domain. Scale bar, 10 μm. Shown at the bottom are line intensity scans from 10-μm segments. (H) Confocal images of WT and Fab1 mutant NMJs stained for VGLUT (green) and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as axonal membrane marker (magenta). An overview is shown at the top. Scale bars, 5 μm. Insets show magnified views. Scale bars, 2 μm. (I) Quantification of representative data shown in (H). WT, 100 ± 11.7; Fab1-RNAi, 51.2 ± 5.5. n = 10 NMJs each. t test was performed. For all graphs, ****p < 0.0001, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01, and ns is p > 0.05. Data are mean ± SEM.
