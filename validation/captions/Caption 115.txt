(A) Two independent Z. marina clonal lines were established from Bodega Bay harbor in large tanks under ambient light, temperature, and flow-through of ocean water. They were maintained through clonal reproduction for 17 years. (B and C) DNA methylomes were sequenced for 15 and 16 ramets of the R and G clones [five technique replicates were generated with the same ramet, G03 (blue)]. Using CG sites within gbM genes as a proxy of the epimutation clock, we inferred the phylogeny of the R and G clones separately. We resequenced genomes from five samples from the R clone and six samples from the G clone. Only 31 and 47 segregating SNPs were identified for clones R and G, respectively. We inferred the phylogeny using the segregating SNPs, and the trees of the R clone and the G clone are shown in (D) and (E). (F and G) The average depth of two gbM-based trees is 1.246 × 10−2 and 1.168 × 10−2 with CVs less than 11%. However, the average depth in the SNP trees is much more variable, with CVs of >27%. (H) The estimated times to the MRCA were further calibrated with these depths and substitution rates.
