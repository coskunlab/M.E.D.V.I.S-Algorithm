(A) Time evolution of temperature and outlet flows under the same experimental conditions as in Fig. 2. (B) The same variables simulated with the theoretical kinetic model described in the supplementary materials for forced temperature oscillations. The outlet flow of CO is out of phase with temperature and products for the theoretical model in (B) as well as for the experimental observations in (A).
