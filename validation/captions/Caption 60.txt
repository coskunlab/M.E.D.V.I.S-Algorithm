The two-qubit structure shown in Fig. 1B was used in these measurements. (A) Relaxation time T1 of the remote qubit measured by an inversion recovery scheme. The exponential fit (solid line) yields a relaxation time T1 of 166 ± 14 ns for the remote qubit. Inset: Labels of ESR transitions used in this figure (same as Fig. 2B). (B) Ramsey measurements of the remote qubit with fS = f1 and fR = f3 + 30 MHz yielding a coherence time T2* = 86 ± 13 ns. Inset: T2* shows a dependence on the tunnel current IDC. (C) Spin-echo measurements of the remote qubit measured with fS = f2 and fR = f3. The exponential fit (solid line) yields a coherence time of T2Echo = 300 ± 54 ns. Inset: T2Echo shows no dependence on IDC. ESR conditions in (A): VDC = 50 mV, IDC = 20 pA, VS = 50 mV, VR = 120 mV, τS = 200 ns; and in (B) and (C): VDC = 50 mV, IDC = 10 pA, VS = 60 mV, VR = 120 mV, τS = 200 ns. The sample was kept at 0.4 K during measurements.
