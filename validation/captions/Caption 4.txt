(A) Open-ended vocal learning species have significantlylarger relative brain sizes than the other species. (B) The difference in brain size between mimic and nonmimic species is not significant. (C) Vocalization repertoire is significantly associated with relative brain size. (D) Speciesâ€™ vocal learning complexity is also significantly associated with relative brain size. Relative brain sizes are the residuals of brain volumes with body size obtained from (43). P values in (A) and (B) are from Wilcoxon tests; R and P values in (C) and (D) are from Spearman correlations, with vocal learning complexity from PC1 of Fig. 3A. ***P < 0.001; *P < 0.05; ns, not significant.
