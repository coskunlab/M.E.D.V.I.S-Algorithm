(A) Bulk properties of functional polyethylenes. (Left) Representative tensile tests of LDPE and N-containing polyethylenes (0.8 to 2.5 mol %). Strain rate = 50 mm min–1. (Middle) Average toughness of 1b with varying percentages of amide incorporation. Error bars represent standard deviation. (Right) Representative tensile tests of waste LDPE (resealable storage bag), waste HDPE (milk jug), 1e (0.3 mol %), and 1f (0.4 mol %). Strain rate = 50 mm min–1. (B) Surface properties of functional polyethylenes. (Left) Lap-shear adhesion tests of 18b (2 mol %) and 5b (2 mol %) as the adhesive interlayers. Error bars represent standard deviation. (Middle) Peel tests of LDPE and 5b. (Right) Water-contact angles of LDPE and 17a-graft-PEG, and image of aqueous solution of 17a-graft-PEG. (C) Rheological measurements. (Left to right) amplitude sweep, frequency sweep, and tan δ plot of LDPE and 1b (2.5 mol %), respectively. Amplitude sweep frequency fixed at 10 rad s–1, frequency sweep fixed at 0.01% strain, temperature 40°C.
