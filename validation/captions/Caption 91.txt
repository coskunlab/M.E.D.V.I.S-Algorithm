(A) Gray whales have experienced major fluctuations in abundance after an initial post-whaling recovery, including three major declines beginning in 1987, 1999, and 2019. (B to E) These declines and subsequent recoveries in the 1990s and 2000s were associated with synchronous changes in (B) births and (C) mortality, as well as changes in nutritive condition in (D) southbound and (E) northbound migrating whales. Black points in (A) and (B) indicate the median estimated abundance and calf production from visual surveys, with standard errors of model estimates (vertical bars). Black points in (D) and (E) indicate the mean values of body condition measurements from each survey year and the standard deviation of observations (vertical bars). In (A) to (E), the black lines indicate the median of the posterior distribution of model-estimated values, and the shaded regions indicate the 95% posterior credible intervals.
