Inactive mines are shown by solid yellow circles, active mines by open red circles, and failed TSFs by purple triangles. The y-axis units are log10 numbers. Symbols for inactive and active mines indicate predicted values from the WAPHA model with 90% confidence intervals; symbols for failed TSFs are observed values for irrigated areas (in square kilometers) affected by 257 documented TDFs.
