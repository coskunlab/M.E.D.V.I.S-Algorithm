(A) Scheme illustrating 3D printing of inorganic nanomaterials from a solution containing NCs (blue spheres) and bisazides using a fs laser (left). NCs are initially separated at a distance (d) of up to >10 times their sizes (r). Diffusion and accumulation bring NCs to the focal point (top right). At reduced interparticle distance, the bonding photochemistry starts from the two-photon activation of bisazides, which then generate nitrene radicals (·

·) and covalently bond adjacent NCs by bridging their ligands (represented by the lines on the blue spheres) (bottom right). The bonded NCs constitute mechanically robust 3D structures that replicate the laser trajectory. (B) Photographs of solutions of various NCs as 3D Pin inks. BQD, GQD, and RQD are II−VI core–shell QDs emitting in blue (CdZnS/ZnS), green (CdSe/CdZnSeS), and red (CdSe/ZnS). (C) UV–visible absorption spectrum and molecular structure of BTO. (D) FTIR and (E) XPS (N1s) spectra of pristine CdSe NC films and printed CdSe structures confirm the underlying photochemistry in 3D Pin. Pristine samples in (D) and (E) refer to spin-coated CdSe NC films with (D) or without (E) BTO linkers. a.u., arbitrary units.
