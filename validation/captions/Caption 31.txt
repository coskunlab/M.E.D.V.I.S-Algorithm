(A) Schematic of the two protein constructs. Key domains and mutations are indicated. Single-letter abbreviations for the amino acid residues are as follows: A, Ala; C, Cys; D, Asp; E, Glu; F, Phe; G, Gly; H, His; I, Ile; K, Lys; L, Leu; M, Met; N, Asn; P, Pro; Q, Gln; R, Arg; S, Ser; T, Thr; V, Val; W, Trp; and Y, Tyr. In the mutants, other amino acids were substituted at certain locations; for example, S207D indicates that serine at position 207 was replaced with aspartic acid. (B) Representative 2D class averages from single-particle cryo-EM analysis of the MKK6DDGRA-p38αT180V complex. Scale bar, 100 Å. (C) Segmented single-particle reconstruction cryo-EM map of the MKK6DDGRA-p38αT180V complex, resolved to 4-Å resolution and colored according to (A). (D) Model of the MKK6DDGRA-p38αT180V complex, showing the overall structure of the complex. MKK6DDGRA-p38αT180V is represented as a cartoon and colored according to (A). AMP-CP nucleotides are represented as balls and sticks (carbon atoms are yellow). The MKK6 linker and A loop are disordered and respectively shown as a full black line and an orange dashed line. The position of the Y182 residue in the p38α A loop is indicated by a red sphere.
