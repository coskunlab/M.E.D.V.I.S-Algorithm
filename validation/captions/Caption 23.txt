(A) Illustration of the improvement learning ability possessed by human brains. With preacquired knowledge about old dogs and rabbits, the learning of new samples (i.e., new dogs) and a new class (i.e., cats) is quickly realized with only a few new inputs. (B) Design considerations and future applications of the memristor-based neuro-inspired computing chip. The chip, designed for fully on-chip learning, integrates all the necessary modules with memristor arrays. It equips edge AI devices with the learning ability, enabling them to quickly adapt to new scenes.
