(A) Evolution of temperature and rate-and-selectivity oscillations (as reactor outlet flows of reactants and products) as a function of the H2/CO ratio at a nominal temperature of 220°C. The horizontal black dashed line represents the CO molecular flow into the reactor and serves to calculate time-averaged reaction rates. Dashed vertical lines distinguish reactant ratios between H2/CO = 1 and 12. φi(t), reactor outlet flow. (B) CO conversion and product selectivities for varying H2/CO ratios at 220°C. (C) Time evolution of oscillations at 200°C (top) and 260°C (bottom) for selected H2/CO ratios. Red bars in the top graph reflect the variation of the oscillation period with time and the H2/CO ratio.
