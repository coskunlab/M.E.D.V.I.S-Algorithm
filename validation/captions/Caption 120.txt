(A) Fragment survival rates (%) from the two independent tank-based transmission experiments conducted in Florida (blue) and Panama (orange). A Cox proportional hazard model detected significant effects of genotype [χ2(effective df = 65, reference df = 99) = 2392, p < 0.0001], experimental tank [χ2(7.8, 9) = 4779, p = 0.00008], and experiment location and/or population [χ2(0.99, 1) = 23,127, p < 0.00001] on fragment survival. Genotype explained 6.1% of the variation in survival, whereas experiment location and/or population (i.e., Florida versus Panama) explained 28.8% of the variation. (B) Normalized disease resistance (one minus the probability of infection; see methods for details) at day 6 of exposure for the 50 Florida and 50 Panama A. cervicornis genotypes that were surveyed. The center line represents the median, box limits are upper and lower quartiles, and whiskers are minimum and maximum values.
