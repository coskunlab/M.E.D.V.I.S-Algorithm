The model places one hydrogen nuclear spin-½ on both PXX•+ and NDI•– (A and B), or only on NDI•– (C and D). The nuclear spins are coupled to each radical with isotropic hyperfine couplings aNDI = 6.3 MHz and aPXX = 10 MHz. (Insets) The simulations are shown with their intensities expanded to highlight features characteristic of CISS. The complete list of simulation parameters is given in table S7.
