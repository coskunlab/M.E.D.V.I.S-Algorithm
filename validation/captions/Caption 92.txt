(A) Estimated annual carrying capacity (Kt) from the population dynamics model, with reference lines at 25,000 (dashed line) and 10,000 (dotted line). (B) Estimated ice access anomaly, which is the Z-scored number of days with 50% or lower ice cover on gray whale feeding grounds. (C) Estimated crustacean biomass anomaly, which is the Z-scored mean grams of carbon of benthic crustaceans on key gray whale feeding grounds. (D) Decline in benthic crustacean per capita biomass from 1970 to 2019, showing the relationship each sampling year between benthic crustacean abundance and biomass in grams of carbon (gC). In (A) to (C), the black lines indicate the median of the posterior distribution of estimates, and the shaded regions indicate the 95% posterior credible intervals.
