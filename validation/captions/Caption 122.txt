(A) Polygenic scores for the top ten SNPs and genomic regions explain 66.9 ± 5.4% of disease resistance (p < 0.0001). (B) Polygenic scores based on the most important 63 SNPs and genomic regions (p < 0.0001) explain 85.3 ± 2.3% of the variation in disease resistance, showing that the inclusion of 53 additional loci improved disease-resistance predictions based on polygenic scores. Individuals represented by blue symbols have above-average polygenic scores and disease resistance; the dark blue points indicate individuals that are highly disease resistant, with polygenic scores and disease-resistance values in the top quartiles. Individuals represented by yellow and red symbols have lower-than-average polygenic scores and disease resistance, with red symbols indicating highly susceptible individuals. Coral genotypes from Florida are labeled with a circle and those from Panama are labeled with a triangle. The gray shaded area indicates ±1 standard error.
