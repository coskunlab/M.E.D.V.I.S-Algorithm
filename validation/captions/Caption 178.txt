(A) Tg of polymer and MOF@polymer MMM. (B) Effect of operating temperature on the separation performance of 59.6 vol % Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@PVA MMM at 1.5 bar. (C) Binary H2-CO2 separation performance of 59.6 vol % Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@PVA MMMs at 120°C and 1.5 bar, and 64.4 vol % Ni(NbOF5)(pyz)3@PVA MMMs at 120°C and 1 MPa with a 3 vol % water vapor content, and comparison with other membranes (tables S4 and S5) (33, 40–48). Error bars indicate the standard deviation from three different samples, in which some error bars are smaller than the symbols. (D) Binary H2-CO2 separation performance of Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@PEG MMM before and after curling at 25°C and 1.5 bar. (Inset) Digital photo of the curved membrane. (E) XRD patterns and SEM images of ZIF@PEG MMM after 2-methylimidazole vapor-induced conversion from Zn(NO3)2@PEG precursor. (F) Separation performance of MOF@PEG MMMs with different MOF species at 25°C and 1.5 bar. Error bars indicate the standard deviation from three different samples. (G) Digital photo of (left) PAN hollow-fiber substrate, (right) Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@PVA MMM, and its cross-sectional SEM images. (H) Digital photo of scaled-up fabricated Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@PVA MMM and its binary H2-CO2 separation performance of 12 portions at 25°C and 1.5 bar.
