STM images of an N-glycopeptide (biantennary N-glycan NGA2F on the KVANKT peptide) (A), and glycolipids, GM3 ganglioside (B) and GD3 ganglioside (C), reveal the glycan, peptide, and ceramide (Cer) domains in the respective molecules (Cer consisted of a fatty acid chain and sphingosine of varying length). STM imaging differentiates individual monosaccharides in the glycoconjugate; i.e., glucose (Glc), galactose (Gal), sialic acid (Sia = Neu5Ac), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), mannose (Man), and fucose (Fuc). STM images were interpreted by structures computed by DFT. Scale bar is 0.5 nm.
