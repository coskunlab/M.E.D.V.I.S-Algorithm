(A) Between 2012 and 2022, we estimate that 285,000 people took part as cartel members, but only 60% were still active by 2022. The cartel career is brief and risky. Roughly 17% of them are dead, and 20% are incapacitated. (B) Number of employees from the top 10 companies in Mexico and the combined size of cartels (27). We estimate that cartels had between 160,000 and 185,000 members combined. (C) Of the 175,000 active cartel members, roughly 17.9% are part of CJNG, 8.9% are part of Cartel de Sinaloa, and 6.2% are from Nueva Familia Michoacanaâ€”the top three cartels in size.
