(A and B) Tensile engineering (A) and true (B) stress-strain curves of GDS, surface GDS, and CG samples at 293 K and 77 K. (C and D) The corresponding strain hardening rate and true strain relations (C) and normalized strain hardening rate by flow stress and true stress relations (D). (E) Strength and ductility synergy of GDS alloy, compared with other high-performing materials at cryogenic temperature. Uniform elongation versus ultimate tensile strength normalized by Young’s modulus of the GDS alloy, compared with those of the same compositions (with homogeneous, gradient-grained structures) at 293 K and 77 K (34–36), other MPE alloys (37–42), and cryogenic steels (21, 43, 44) tensioned from 4.2 K to 77 K in the literature. The hollow five-pointed star denotes the property of the topmost GDS surface with the use of the strength value estimated from the Hv/3 and uniform elongation data from tensile test of GDS layer. The error bars represent standard deviations from more than three independent tensile tests. DC, dislocation cell; UFG, ultrafine grain; HGS, heterogeneous grain structure; FG, fine grain; NG, nanograin.
