(A) The symbols represent S(E) computed from the solid lines in Fig. 3E with Eq. 3, demonstrating data collapse onto one continuous curve. The solid line represents S(E) computed for the V1 band from continuum-model calculations. (B) The symbols represent χ′(E) computed from the solid lines in Fig. 3E with Eq. 4. The solid line represents χ′(E) computed from continuum-model calculations. See (42) for a discussion of the error analysis.
