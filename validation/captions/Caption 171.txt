Shown are inactive metal mines [(A), solid blue circles], active metal mines [(B), solid red circles], number of active/inactive mines by continent (C), TSFs [(D), blue triangles = intact, red triangles = failed], and number of intact and failed TSFs by continent (E). Disaggregated on a continental scale, North America (active, 11,871; inactive, 80,995) and Oceania (active, 3430; inactive, 53,233) have the largest number of mines, followed by South America (active, 3240; inactive, 14,577), Europe (active, 1024; inactive, 9080), Asia (active, 1817; inactive, 1473), and Africa (active, 1227; inactive, 377) (table S1). Oceania, Europe, North America, and South America are mostly affected by inactive mining, whereas active mining activities are more important in Africa and Asia (table S1). We recorded 11,844 TSFs, of which 257 had failed. Asia has nearly half of the worldâ€™s TSFs, with North America recording both in absolute (n = 107) and proportional (42%) terms the largest number of TDFs (table S4).
