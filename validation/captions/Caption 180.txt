(A) Equilibrium between (top) homodimeric inclusion complexes of a PS and an E-azoarene—(PS)2⊂H and E2⊂H, respectively—and (bottom) the heterodimeric complex (E⋅PS)⊂H. Only E residing within the heterodimer, but not the homodimer, can be switched with visible light. The resulting Z is encapsulated as a sole guest (if enough host is available) and cannot be sensitized either. (B) Absorption spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of (ps1)2⊂H and (E-1)2⊂H (dotted brown line) and changes in the spectra accompanying irradiation with green light (λmax = 525 nm, denoted by green shading). The dotted blue line represents the absorption spectrum of (ps1)2⊂H. (C) Absorption spectrum of a 1:1 mixture of (ps1)2⊂H and (E-9)2⊂H [dotted brown line; predominantly (E-9⋅ps1)⊂H] and changes in the spectra accompanying irradiation with green light (λmax = 525 nm, denoted by green shading). The dotted blue line represents the absorption spectrum of (ps1)2⊂H. (D) The x-ray crystal structure of the heterodimeric complex (E-9⋅ps1)⊂H (from the left: front view, side view, and top view; light gray, host H; dark gray, E-9; green, ps1; water molecules, counterions, and host protons omitted for clarity). (E) Graph following DESC of 9 in the presence of different equiv. of ps1 (the data were normalized to the 0 to 1 range, except the experiment with no PS; raw spectra can be found in fig. S76). Abs., absorbance. (F) Evolution of the emission intensity of ps1 under 515-nm light (used both to induce DESC and excite fluorescence) as a function of the amount of 9. Em. int., emission intensity. (G) More than 100 cycles of reversible photoisomerization of 9 induced solely by visible light (E→Z, DESC with 525-nm light for 2 min; Z→E, direct photoexcitation using 435-nm light for 30 s). The amount of the E isomer is proportional to absorbance at 353 nm; the absorption at 480 nm originates from the (ps1)2⊂H homodimer. norm., normalized.
