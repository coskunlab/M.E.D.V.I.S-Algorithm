(A) XRD patterns of CuSiF6, CuSiF6@PEG precursor, Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3 simulated, and Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@PEG MMM. (B) Positron annihilation lifetime spectra of CuSiF6@PVA precursor and Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@PVA MMM. (C) Metal salt conversion rate and the corresponding MOF volume loading in MOF@PEG MMM with different Mw of PEG (fixed CuSiF6, polymer = 5:1) and CuSiF6/PEG mass ratios (fixed PEG Mw of 10,000). (D) Transport resistance schematic of Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@polymer MMM with different MOF loadings. (E) Binary H2-CO2 separation performance of Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3@polymer MMMs with different MOF loadings at 25°C and 1.5 bar and comparison with that of pure MOF membranes and MOF-based MMMs. Error bars indicate the standard deviation from three different samples. The data for those points are supplemented by tables S1 to S3 (4, 17–37). (F) (Left) CO2 and H2 diffusion pathways (indicated with arrows) in the MOF structure. To depict the positions of CO2 molecules along the diffusion pathway, the oxygen atoms of CO2 molecules are shown by the colors green, pink, and ice blue, respectively. (Right) The superimposed vdW surfaces of Cu(SiF6)(pyz)3 and CO2 (red) and H2 (green) molecules.
