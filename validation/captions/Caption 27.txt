(A) Front (top) and rear (bottom) view of the actuator and its component materials. (B) Diagram of the combustion actuation process. (C) Time-lapse image of a single actuation cycle. t, time. (D) Images of the actuator at different maximum displacements for a range of fuel-oxidizer (equivalence) ratios (ϕ). Photos were taken at the same actuation frequency f = 10 Hz. The dotted boxes indicate matching images in (C) and (D), which both occurred at ϕ = 0.45 and f = 10 Hz. Scale bars [(C) and (D)], 5 mm. (E) Actuator displacement and (F) blocked force as a function of different frequencies for a series of equivalence ratios (n = 5 actuator tests, error bars = 1 SD). The inset plot shows the force profile achieved when tested at ϕ = 0.45 and f = 50 Hz. Data are not available above f = 50 Hz for ϕ = 0.24 and 0.28 or above f = 75 Hz for ϕ = 0.32 because the volume of fuel in the actuator under these conditions is too small to sustain combustion.
