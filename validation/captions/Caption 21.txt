(A) Presynaptic numbers in an abdominal segment of C4da neurons at 24 hours APF. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and the data range. ****P < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney test. (B) (Top) Relative expression levels of Tkv::GFP at the third instar larval stage (larvae) or 8 hours APF (pupae) in wild-type and ube3a-null mutants. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, the data range except for outliers, and outliers. ****P < 0.0001, n.s. P ≥ 0.05, Mann-Whitney test. (C) Presynaptic numbers in an abdominal segment of C4da neurons at 24 hours APF. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, the data range except for outliers, and outliers. ****P < 0.0001, n.s. P ≥ 0.05, Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. (D) Presynaptic numbers in an abdominal segment of C4da neurons at 24 hours APF. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, the data range except for outliers, and outliers. ****P < 0.0001, **P < 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. (E) Ube3a down-regulates presynaptic BMP signaling for presynapse elimination in C4da neurons.
