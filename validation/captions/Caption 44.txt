(A) X-ray radiography images of the diamond shocked along the [100] direction. The numbers on each image indicate the XFEL probe timing relative to the drive laser irradiation. The vertical lines that appear across the entire field of view are the texture on the unpolished lateral surfaces of the diamond. The two large circles with concentric scattering patterns are caused by scattering from the debris on a beryllium window upstream of the XFEL. (B) Undistorted diamond lattice structures (37) with the corresponding plane orientations. (C) Fast Fourier transform (FFT)–filtered image showing the stacking faults observed in the 16-ns shot. The corresponding area is indicated as the yellow dashed rectangle in (A). The orange arrows serve to guide the eyes to one of the bands formed nonparallel to the diamond {111} planes (see text). (D) X-ray radiography images when diamonds are shocked along [110] direction. The 12-ns image is identical to the one shown in Fig. 1B. (E) Undistorted lattice structure showing the plane orientations. (F) FFT-filtered image of the [110] shock at 16 ns. The errors shown on the angles noted in (C) and (F) represent 1σ of multiple measurements (18).
