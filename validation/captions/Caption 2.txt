(A to H) Four cognitive measures (y axes) compared between species grouped by vocal learning features (x axes: closed-ended, which includes vocal nonlearning species; open-ended; and nonmimic or mimic). (I to L) Correlation analyses between the four cognitive behavioral measures (y axes) and vocalization repertoire size (x axis). Values are ranked means of species performance from all individuals (sample sizes are shown in the legend). P values in (A) to (H) are from Wilcoxon tests; R and P values in (I) to (L) are from Spearman correlations. Regression lines are for illustration purposes to show the significance and direction of relationships. Images to the left are examples of birds in the different tasks, which are snapshots from videos taken by the authors. ***P < 0.001; *P < 0.05; ns, not significant.
