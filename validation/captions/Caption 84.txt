TREPR spectra of (R)-1-h9, (S)-1-h9, and 2-h9 (A and B) and (R)-1-d9, (S)-1-d9, and 2-d9 (C and D) oriented in the nematic liquid crystal 5CB at 85 K and 100 ns after a 450-nm, 7-ns laser pulse with the long axis of each molecule 0° [(A) and (C)] and 90° [(B) and (D)] relative to the applied magnetic field direction. (Insets) The spectra are shown with their intensities expanded to highlight features characteristic of CISS. TDAF, time after laser pulse.
