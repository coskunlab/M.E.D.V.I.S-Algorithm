(A) Representative confocal images of grafted human neurons of 18-month-old control (n = 4) and amyloid (n = 4) mice. (B) Scatter plot comparing log fold changes (LFC) in APP/PS1 mice at 10 months and Rag2−/−/AppNL-G-F mice at 6 months old. Blue genes are significantly changed in both models (R2 = 0.81). (C) Representative confocal images showing NP-tau and neuronal soma tau (D) in 18-month-old control (n = 4) and amyloid (n = 4) mice. White arrows indicate X34 and NP-tau–positive cells. HUNU, human nucleus. Quantification of (E) ﻿AT8-positive tau, (F) PHF1-positive tau, (G) MC1-positive tau around Aβ plaque within 20 μm diameter in 18-month-old animals (n = 4, >100 plaques per mice). N.D, not detected. (H) Representative light microscope Gallyas silver stain images from 18-month-old control (n = 4) and amyloid (n = 4) grafted animals. (I) Electron micrograph image of immunogold-labeled sarkosyl insoluble tau fibrils isolated from 18-month-old control (n = 4) and amyloid (n = 4) mice. Tau fibrils are indicated with white (top panel) or green (bottom panel) arrows. (J) Quantification of plasma p-tau181 levels (every dot represents one mouse) and (K) p-tau231 levels from 18-month-old grafted and nongrafted mice. (L) Number of human neurons at 6 months after transplantation in control (n = 6) and amyloid (n = 6) mice using qPCR. (M) Confocal images taken from 6-month-old amyloid animals grafted with stem cell–derived mouse neurons (n = 4) did not stain with pathological tau markers (AT8, PHF1, or MC1) or (N) mouse-specific necrosome antibodies [pRIPK1(Ser166), pRIPK3 (Thr231/Thr232), or pMLKL (Ser345)]. The full panel, along with control mice, is shown in fig. S4, C and D. Scale bars: 30 μm [(A), (C), (D), (M), and (N)], 50 μm (H), 200 nm [(I), top row], 100 nm [(I), bottom row]. Values are presented as mean ± SEM. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey’s post hoc test for multiple comparisons was used in (J) to (K), and Student’s t test was used in (M).
