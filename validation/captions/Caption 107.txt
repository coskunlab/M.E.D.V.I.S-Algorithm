. (A) Observed far-field emission distribution
under s− pump with a power of 0.22 mW. Inset shows the intensity profiles of the |s−
/−kRi (or |s−
/+kRi)
emission spots with a FWHM of 0.050k0 (or 0.062k0). (B) Corresponding emission spectra of the two spots
from (A) and a significant amplification of DR from ~2.8% of SE background to ~40% of cavity emission
(green line). (C) Intensity (L-L) and linewidth evolutions of |s−
/−kRi and |s−
/+kRi emission against s−
pump power. Inset shows L-L curves in linear scale. The DR (green squares) and VPA (black circles) are
also plotted to show three distinct regions below, near, and above the thresholds. The slight discrepancy between
experiments and fitting is attributed to the high sensitivity of the lasing intensity around the thresholds. The
thresholds PðcoÞ
th and PðcrÞ
th are 0.11 mW (14.0 W/cm2
) and 0.18 mW (22.9 W/cm2
), respectively. (D to F) Same
measurements as in (A) to (C) but under s+ pump.
