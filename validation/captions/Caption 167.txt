(A) Overview of the experimental approach enabling projection-specific single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of neuronal subpopulations projecting from the thoracic spinal cord to walking execution centers. (B) Clustering tree of neuronal subpopulations in the thoracic spinal cord. (C) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) visualization of neuronal nuclei revealing 28 neuron subpopulations (left). Individual nuclei are colored by the proportion of their nearest neighbors obtained from sorted projection neurons (eGFP density), revealing a primary origin from SCVsx2::Hoxa7::Zfhx3â†’lumbar neurons (right). (D) Overview of the experimental approach enabling snRNA-seq after natural spinal cord repair. (E) Chronophotography of mice before and after natural spinal cord repair. (F) Walking was quantified using principal component analysis applied to gait parameters calculated from kinematic recordings. In this denoised space, each dot represents a mouse (n > 10 gait cycles per mouse, n = 6 mice per group, n = 5 mice in the uninjured group). Larger dots represent the mean of each experimental group. The first principal component (PC1) distinguished gaits from mice without SCI from mice with the most severe paralysis, found immediately after the second hemisection. Walking scores were thus quantified as the scores on PC1. Analysis of factor loadings on PC1 revealed that the percentage of paw dragging, the extent of whole-limb oscillation (virtual limb connecting the hip to the toe), and step height were the parameters that showed high correlation with PC1. Bars report the mean values of these gait parameters. Raw data and statistics and provided in data S2. (G) UMAP visualization of neuronal nuclei revealing 28 neuron subpopulations (top) and colored by Augur cell type prioritization (AUC, area under the curve), identifying perturbation-responsive neuronal subpopulations when comparing mice that had undergone natural repair versus uninjured mice (bottom).
