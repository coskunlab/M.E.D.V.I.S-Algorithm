For the 10,000 post-convergence model runs of the MCMC algorithm, their accepted inputs across the extinction boundary were recorded, and their mean and 95% credible interval were calculated. We show the accepted values of gas emissions [as carbon and sulfur (A)], organic carbon export relative to steady-state values (B), relative carbonate carbon export (C), and relative organic carbon remineralization (D), over a period spanning 2 million years, from 67 to 65 Ma.
