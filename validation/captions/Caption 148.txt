In both panels, the disk of Europa is indicated by a black circle centered at 2.7°N, 93°W. Gray dashed lines indicate the 45°W, 90°W, and 135°W meridians and the 60°S, 30°S, 0°N, 30°N, and 60°N parallels. The boundaries (11) of large-scale chaos regions Tara Regio (~10°S, 75°W) and Powys Regio (~0°S, 150°W) are outlined in black within the disk. (A) Map of the band area (indicated by the color bar) of the entire ν3 CO2 band. The strongest absorption occurs in Tara Regio to the right of the 90°W meridian. CO2 is also concentrated in parts of the chaos region Powys Regio on the left portion of the disk. (B) Map of the ratio (color bar) between the 4.25-μm and 4.27-μm peaks within the CO2 band. The spatial pixels outlined in white mark the locations of the spectra shown in Fig. 1. The 4.25-μm peak is the stronger of the two within the chaos terrain and at low latitudes, whereas the 4.27-μm peak is stronger in the colder, more ice-rich northern latitudes.
