(A to D) Quantifications of the number of presynaptic marker puncta in an abdominal segment of C4da neurons at [(A) and (C)] third instar larval stage or [(B) and (D)] 24 hours APF. Box plots indicate the median, 25th and 75th percentiles, the data range except for outliers, and outliers. ****P < 0.0001, ***P < 0.001, **P < 0.01, n.s. P ≥ 0.05, Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s multiple comparisons test. (Bottom) Presynapses in the abdominal segments. ppk, pickpocket. (E) Distinct E3 ligases, Ube3a and Cullin1, act in presynapse elimination and dendrite pruning, respectively.
