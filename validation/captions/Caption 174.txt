(A and C) Regional index maps for the UK and Eastern European sites, respectively. (B and D) Examples of WAPHA modeling and mapping of contaminated floodplains and river channel reaches linked to inactive and active mines in River Swale in northern England (B) and in Bulgaria (D). Inactive mines are shown by solid yellow circles, active mines by open red circles. The stream network is shown by blue lines and floodplains denoted in hatched black fill. Contaminated river channel reaches and floodplains are shown in red (contamination from a mine to the distance given by the lower confidence interval), deep pink (contamination beyond the lowest confidence interval extending to the distance predicted by the model), and light pink (contamination beyond the predicted distance extending to the upper confidence interval).
