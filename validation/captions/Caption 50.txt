(A) Recording setup for miniature microscope recordings. (B) Gal-Cre animals were injected into the MPOA with AAV-FLEx-GCaMP7s and implanted with a GRIN lens. GCaMP7s expression and GRIN lens position are shown. (C) Experimental design (see materials and methods). (D) Sample recording frames with detected neurons and example activity traces from a virgin. (E) Number of detected (nonsilent) neurons per animal (n = 5 mice). (F and I) Temporal profile of MPOAGal responses during pup retrieval (F) or sniffing (I) in virgins, at D18, and at D50 (162, 77, and 93 neurons from n = 5 mice). Dashed lines indicate action onset. Order was based on hierarchical clustering sorted by mean cluster response onset. (G and J) Fraction of neurons with positive evoked response during pup retrieval (G) or sniffing (J) (n = 5 mice). (H and K) Averaged Z score for neurons activated during pup retrieval in virgins, at D18, and at D50 (115, 41, and 63 neurons from 5, 5, and 4 mice) (H) or sniffing (122, 51, and 86 neurons from 5, 5, and 4 mice) (K). Statistics by two-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test, and gray bars indicate periods of significant difference for Vir versus D18 and Vir versus D50. (L) Correlation between normalized tuning index for responses to pup sniffing and normalized mean baseline activities at D18 (coefficient of determination r2 = 0.202; P < 0.001). (M) Selectivity of chemoinvestigation-associated responses for indicated stimulus pairs at Vir, D18, and D50 (142, 35, and 108 cells from n = 4, 3, and 4 mice) compared with pups. A selectivity score of 1 means the neuron is only activated during pup sniffing, a score of 0 means selective activation during sniffing of other stimulus, and a score of 0.5 equals a nonselective response (see materials and methods). (N) Example MPOAGal neuronal activity at Vir and D18 during object investigation in LDA space (int, intruder; obj, object). Temporal bins were used as features. Ellipsoids represent 95% confidence area of neuronal activity to each stimulus. (O) Separability of indicated stimulus combinations by the MPOAGal population [Rand Index (RI), n = 4, 3, and 4 mice]. (P) Correlation between separability (pup versus intruder) and activated fraction of neurons during pup retrieval (r2 = 0.56; P < 0.001). Statistics by paired t tests in (E), (G), and (J); mixed linear model with mouse ID as group in (M); linear regression in (L) and (P); and unpaired t tests in (O). Scale bar in (B), 500 Î¼m. ***P < 0.001; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05.
