19F NMR yields are given with isolated yields shown in parentheses. NMR yields were determined by 19F NMR spectroscopy using fluorobenzene as an internal standard. See supplementary materials for experimental details. For the reactions corresponding to the yields in the first row, gas-Mg2(dobdc) was freshly prepared and dispensed using a solid-addition funnel. For the reactions corresponding to the yields in the second row, gas-Mg2(dobdc) wax capsules were stored on the benchtop for 24 hours before they were broken to dispense gas-Mg2(dobdc). (A) Scope of Negishi coupling of (hetero)aryl halides and VDF-ZnCl•TMEDA synthesized from VDF-Mg2(dobdc). OTf, trifluoromethanesulfonate; s-BuLi, sec-butyllithium; Ts, p-toluenesulfonyl. *Pd(PPh3)4; †8 hours, 10 mol % XPhos Pd G3; ‡18 hours, 10 mol % XPhos Pd G3; §11 hours, 10 mol % XPhos Pd G3. (B) Scope of Pd-catalyzed Heck coupling of (hetero)aryl bromides and TFP using TFP-Mg2(dobdc). *XantPhos Pd G3 (2 mol %) and tetrabutylammonium bromide (1 equivalent). (C) Scope of Fe-catalyzed trifluoromethylation of (hetero)arenes using TFMI-Mg2(dobdc). Fc, ferrocene. †0.15 mmol FeSO4·7H2O (0.3 equivalents), 50°C; §50°C.
