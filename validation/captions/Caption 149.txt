(A) Spectra (average of 4 spatial pixels) of Tara Regio (green) and a location north of Tara Regio (blue). Labels indicate the ν3 band of CO2, the 3.5-μm band of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the 3.1-μm Fresnel reflectance peak of water ice. Also shown for comparison are a spectrum of Occator crater on Ceres (dotted black line), which has absorption due to carbonate minerals (37); a spectral ratio of the tiger stripes region on Enceladus relative to its nearby regions (dashed black line) (36), which exhibits absorptions interpreted as organics; and a continuum-removed spectrum of the trailing hemisphere of Iapetus (dash-dotted black line), which shows bands at ~3.3 μm and ~3.45 μm due to aromatic and aliphatic organics, respectively (34). All spectra have been normalized at 3.6 μm, and the Ceres, Enceladus, and Iapetus spectra are offset for display by 0.55, 0.5, and 0.78 units, respectively. (B) The ratio (solid black line) between the spectra of Tara Regio and the region to its north from (A). The same spectra of Enceladus, Iapetus, and Ceres as shown in (A) are included for comparison, with additional bands labeled. We attribute the 3.5-μm band in the ratio spectrum to excess H2O2, which has previously been seen to be more abundant in Tara Regio (40). No other absorption bands are evident in the ratio spectrum, except for a ≲1% deviation from the continuum near 4.0 μm, which is too shallow to constitute a detection of carbonates and is located close to the gap in NIRSpec wavelength coverage. (C) Optical imaging mosaic of Europa projected to the JWST observing geometry (51) overlain with the boundaries of the chaos terrain [black outlines (11)]. Also shown are the locations of the NIRSpec pixels that we used to produce the average spectra shown in (A), for Tara Regio (green squares) and the terrain to its north (blue squares). Dashed white lines mark the 45°W, 90°W, and 135°W meridians and the 60°S, 30°S, 0°N, 30°N, and 60°N parallels.
