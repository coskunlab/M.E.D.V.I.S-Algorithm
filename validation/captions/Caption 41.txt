(A) Herbarium sheets preserve not only the genomes of individual plants but also those of many associated species: microbes, such as bacteria and fungi, as well as macroorganisms, such as insects. (B) Herbarium specimens also harbor a plethora of other types of data. Phenology and, occasionally, environmental or ethnobotanical information is recorded on the label. Anatomical features allow direct morphometric measurements. Other molecular data are available, from simple micronutrients and atomic isotopes to complex molecules such as alkaloids, RNAs, and proteins.
