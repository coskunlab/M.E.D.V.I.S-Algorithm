(A) Excited-state decay of transition metal complexes as described by Marcus theory. (Left) Marcus normal region where the excited-state lifetime decreases with increasing driving force. (Right) Marcus inverted region where excited-state decay rates slow down and lifetimes increase when the driving force exceeds the reorganization energy associated with ground-state recovery. (B) (Left) The excited-state lifetimes of the Co(III) polypyridine complexes systematically increase with increasing driving force for ground-state recovery, which is consistent with Marcus inverted region behavior. (Right) A plot of the experimentally determined excited-state lifetimes as a function of the driving force for ground-state recovery. The latter were obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the excited-state energies that follow the general trend obtained from experimentally determined spectroscopic transitions. The data are well described by Marcus theory, revealing a reorganization energy for this isostructural series of chromophores of 0.55 eV (4500 cmâ€“1), significantly smaller than the driving force and confirming that the dynamics of this class of compounds occur in the inverted region.
