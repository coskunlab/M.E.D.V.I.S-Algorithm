(A) Predicted probability of earthwork presence for 1-km2 cells across six Amazonian regions using an inhomogeneous Poisson process predictive model: central Amazonia (CA), eastern Amazonia (EA), Guiana Shield (GS), northwestern Amazonia (NwA), southern Amazonia (SA), and southwestern Amazonia (SwA). Areas not modeled (NA) are greyed out. (B) Predictive probability function for the number of as yet undetected earthworks; the dark area under the curve represents the credibility interval (CI) of the probabilities associated with each number. (C) Boxplot of the estimated relative contribution of each covariate; the yellow diamond indicates the mean value. SCC, soil cation concentration; TPI, terrain position index; HAND, height above the nearest drainage. (D) Individual predicted probability of earthwork presence against intensity covariates. For projected areas across each Amazonian region on different probability thresholds, see table S2, and for the IPP model on continuous values, see fig. S1.
