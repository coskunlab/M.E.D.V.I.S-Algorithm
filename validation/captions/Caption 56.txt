(A) Schematic: A sensor spin qubit (Ti, blue) is placed under the apex of a spin-polarized STM tip for readout. Remote qubits are constructed at precise separations to the sensor qubit by atom manipulation. Each remote qubit is composed of a spin-1/2 Ti atom (red) and a single-atom magnet (Fe) (green), where Fe’s magnetic field gradient, in combination with the RF electric field between the tip and the sample, coherently drives remote qubits. (B and C) Constant-current STM images showing atom-by-atom construction of a multi-qubit structure composed of two (B) and three (C) qubits (image size: 5.0 × 5.0 nm). Inset: atomic registry of the structure in (C). Structure in (B) has the same configuration but without remote qubit 2. (D and E) Continuous-wave ESR spectra measured with the tip positioned on the sensor qubit in the two-qubit (D) and three-qubit (E) structure. The quantum states of the sensor qubit are labeled by the first kets. Each ESR transition of the sensor qubit distinguishes a quantum state of the remote qubits (the second kets). The measured spin-polarized tunnel-current signal ΔI is the difference between averaged signals in lock-in A and B subcycles (fig. S10), which reflects the change of the sensor spin polarization due to applied coherent control pulses [see section 4 of (19)]. Imaging conditions in (B) and (C): sample bias voltage VDC = 100 mV, time-averaged tunnel current IDC = 10 pA. ESR conditions in (D) and (E): VDC = 50 mV, IDC = 20 pA, zero-to-peak RF voltage VRF = 30 mV. The sample was kept at 0.4 K during measurements.
