Ascorbate (Asc), Fe2+, and 2OG were added into the reaction mixtures as described in the materials and methods, unless specified. (A) CHLC produced Chl c2 and Chl c1 from DVP and MVP. The activity required Fe2+ and 2OG and was enhanced by Asc. (B) CHLC produced Chl c2 from DVP purified to be free of MVP. See below for hypotheses on the contaminating peak 1 and on peak 3 generated by CHLC. (C) A schematic representation of the proposed substrate specificities. Red crosses indicate conversions that would not occur as a result of substrate discrimination. (D) CHLC does not act on the product of POR (DVC) containing a chlorin skeleton instead of a porphyrin skeleton. The peaks that we labeled DVP-like (peak 1) or MVP-like (peak 2) are similar to DVP or MVP in their absorption peak wavelengths in the blue light region (see Fig. 2H) and could be their isomers yielded from the pigment preparation process (50). The peaks labeled Chl c2–like (peak 3) and Chl c1–like (peak 4) are also similar to the corresponding compounds in absorption properties (Fig. 2H). (E) The absorbance profiles of pigment peaks from the experiment in (D). (F) Enzymatic analyses of the recombinant proteins for the orthologs of PtCHLC.
