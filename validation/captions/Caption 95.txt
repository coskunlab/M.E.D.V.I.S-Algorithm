(A) CT26 cells (5 × 105) were implanted subcutaneously into the hind flank of BALB/c mice. When tumor volumes reached ~100 mm3, mice were treated with 5 × 106 CFU of engineered probiotic strains (ProX) producing Tag (ProTag) or an empty control (Pro−). On days 2 and 5 pbt, tumors were treated with 2.5 × 106 mGFP28z+ T cells, and growth was monitored by caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days. Mean tumor trajectories are shown. Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 10 biological replicates. (B) A20 cells (5 × 105) were implanted subcutaneously into the hind flank of BALB/c mice. When tumor volumes reached 200 to 300 mm3, mice were treated with probiotics as in (A). On day 2 pbt, tumors were treated with 1 × 106 mGFP28z+ T cells. Mean tumor trajectories are shown. Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 3 biological replicates. (C to E) MC38 cells (5 × 105) were implanted subcutaneously into both hind flanks of C57BL/6 mice. When tumor volumes reached ~150 mm3, the left tumor received a single injection of 2 × 106 CFU ProTag, Pro−, or a PBS control (C). On days 2 and 5 pbt, tumors on the left flank were treated with 1.5 × 106 mGFP28z+ T cells. Tumors on the right flank were left untreated. Mean tumor trajectories of the treated tumors (D) and untreated tumors (E) are shown. Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 4 biological replicates. (F to J) C57BL/6 mice were grafted and treated as in (C). On day 9 pbt, treated tumors and tumor-draining lymph nodes were retrieved for analysis by flow cytometry. (F) Frequency of IT CD69+CAR+ T cells; representative flow cytometry histograms (left) and quantification are shown (right). Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 3 biological replicates. (G) Frequencies of CD69+ tumor infiltrating CD8+ and CD4+Foxp3− (Tconv.) CAR– T cells. Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 3 biological replicates. (H) Frequency of Ki-67+ tumor-infiltrating CAR−CD8+ T cells from each treatment group. (I and J) Frequency of activated (CD40+MHCII+) (I) and PD-L1+ (J) proinflammatory monocytes (CD11b+Ly6C+) in the lymph nodes of treated and control mice. Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 3 biological replicates. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ****P < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA [(A), (B), (D), (E), and (G)] or one-way ANOVA [(F), (H), (I), and (J)]; ANOVAs performed with Holm–Sidak multiple comparison correction.
