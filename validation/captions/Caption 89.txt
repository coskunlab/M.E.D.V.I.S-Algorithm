(A) Schematic of the high ionization behavior of the IC-PANF membrane segment (the 3D interconnected layered network with internal larger microvoids amplified the exposed water-contacted surface) and a snapshot of the diffusion of H2O, Na+, and SO42− inside the pores (green spheres for Na+ and yellow spheres for SO42− by molecular simulation). (B and C) Areal R-COO− and R-NH3+ density as a function of pH by experiments. (D and E) Zeta potential (D) and water permeance and Na2SO4 rejection (E) as a function of pH. Error bars represent the SDs of three independent measurements.
