(A) Oxidation of the radical-lost ground state DOPAY126 (gray) displaces DOPAY126-D88 and introduces a water molecule (w1) to facilitate the proton transfer from the redirected amino group of K213 (cyan). (B) Concurrently, the cavity surrounding the generated DOPAY126 radical is reshaped, shown in surface representation (radical-lost state and radical state in gray and cyan, respectively). Primarily, Q91 flips away from Y163 to block access of any further oxidant from NrdI through the R2-NrdI channel and L183 and F187 flip to reshape the cavity and facilitate electron transfer from W52 to DOPAY126. (C) Structure superposition of MfR2 in the radical (cyan) and radical-lost (gray) states at the R1 binding interface. Reshaping of the pockets surrounding the DOPAY126 leads to conformational changes protruding to the R2-R1 interaction surface and binding to protein R1 completes the PCET pathway. (D) PCET is initiated by a proton transfer (PT) from the amino group of K213 to DOPAY126 mediated by w1, and simultaneously an electron transfer from W52 to DOPAY126, thus translocating the radical toward the active site C394 of R1. R1 (represented in red) is modeled in complex with the radical-state MfR2 using the cryo-EM structure of the R1-R2 holocomplex from E. coli (PDB ID: 6w4x) (7).
