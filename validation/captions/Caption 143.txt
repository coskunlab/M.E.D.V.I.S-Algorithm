(A) Dot plot from single-nuclear RNA-seq that shows gene expression of various connexins and pannexins across cardiac cell population in the heart harvested 7 days after MI. EC, endothelial cell. (B) Comparison of expression of connexins/pannexins in CFs and myocytes shown as a percentage of cells expressing the gene of interest. (C) Schematic of generation of the Cx43CKO-CF-ChR2 animal with administration of tamoxifen to induce Cre-mediated recombination. (D) Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) that demonstrates Cx43 expression in CFs from Cx43CKO-CF-ChR2 animals compared with CFs from CF-ChR2 control animals (data are represented as mean Â± SD, **P < 0.01, n = 3). (E to H) Intact perfused hearts of Cx43CKO-CF-ChR2 animals harvested 10 days after MI were subjected to optical stimulation of scar tissue. (E) Electrical recording of heart before, during, and after optical stimulation at 7 Hz (blue bars represent optical stimulation pulses; representative tracings, n = 8). (F to H) Magnified electrograms demonstrate atrial (black arrows) and ventricular activity (blue arrows) before (F), during (G), and after (H) stimulation. Note dissociation of atrial and ventricular activity during optical stimulation. (I) Cardiac electrical recording after optical stimulation of scar at 9 Hz. (J to M) Surface ECG of live Cx43CKO-CF-ChR2 animal subjected to optical stimulation of scar at 10 days after MI. (J) ECG recording before, during, and after stimulation at 7 Hz. (K to M) Atrial (P wave, black arrows) and ventricular (QRS complexes, blue arrows) activity before (K), during (L), and after (M) stimulation. Note dissociation of atrial and ventricular activity during stim followed by resumption of normal sinus rhythm after stimulation (representative tracings, n = 9 per group).
