(A) Overview of the experimental approach enabling regeneration across an anatomically complete SCI and into walking execution centers. (B) tRFP-labeled axons in composite tiled scans of horizontal sections from representative mice. Dotted lines demarcate astrocyte proximal and distal borders around the lesion core. Dashed line demarcates the lesion center. Line graph demonstrates axon density at specific distances past lesion centers (normalized to the density rostral to the lesion site). Statistics indicate Tukey honest significant difference (HSD) following one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). ***P < 0.001 LV-GDNF versus SCI only. †††P < 0.001 LV-GDNF versus 2 depots and 3 depots groups. (Right) Bar graph indicates the AUC of axon density in the walking execution center. Statistics indicate Tukey HSD following one-way ANOVA (all P < 0.001). (C) Whole spinal cord visualization of regenerating projections from the lower thoracic spinal cord that project to walking execution centers. (D) Representative individual electrophysiological traces after microstimulation of the ventral gigantocellular nucleus (vGi). (Bottom) Peak-to-peak amplitude of the evoked potentials in each experimental group, expressed as a percentage of uninjured mouse responses (Pairwise Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P = 0.0064). (E) (Top) The enrichment of regenerated neurons among neuronal populations of the mouse lumbar spinal cord is shown within a clustering tree of spinal cord neurons defined in four different clustering resolutions, demonstrating the robustness of these findings to the resolution at which transcriptionally defined neuronal subtypes are defined. (Bottom) The same enrichments are visualized on a progression of UMAPs. (F) Cholera toxin subunit B (CTB)–labeled regenerated neurons with Vsx2 immunohistochemical colabeling above the anatomically complete SCI.
