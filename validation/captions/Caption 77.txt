(A and B) The cross-sectional SEM (A) and bright-field TEM (B) images of the GDS surface layer at 3% tensile strain, showing the widespread occurrence of two sets of SF bundles (indicated by the white arrows) at different {111} slip planes and across multiple dislocation cell patterns in the topmost surface. The white line with double arrows in (A) denotes the loading axis (LA). The corresponding SAED patterns in (B) contain two sets of parallel streaks from SFs (along two [111] directions, noted by the white arrows). (C) An aberration-corrected HAADF-STEM image taken from one SF bundle, revealing an ultrahigh density of SFs and TBs. (D and E) The cross-sectional SEM images of the GDS surface layer at 40% tensile strain, showing an example of one grain containing denser mutually inclined planar interfaces (denoted as white dashed lines). (F) HAADF-STEM image showing massive nanomosaics in the one grain interior. The inset at the bottom left is the corresponding SAED pattern. (G) Atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM image showing a typical example of several tiny mosaics of ~10-nm scale in size (sketched as red dashed curves) containing atomic-scaled SFs at different {111} slip planes. The numbers in red denote the misorientation angles of the interfaces separating the adjacent SFed mosaics. (H) Schematic illustration showing the dynamic structural refinement process of initial dislocation cell structure enabled by the formation of extensive nanomosaics during the tensile experiment at 77 K.
