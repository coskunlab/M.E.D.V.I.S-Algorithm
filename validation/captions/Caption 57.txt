(A) Schematic of the measurement scheme. Two RF tones, RF-S and RF-R, were applied to the STM tip for the coherent control of the sensor and remote qubit, respectively. The atomic structure used in this figure is shown in Fig. 1B. (B) Energy diagram and ESR transitions of the two-qubit system. (C) Typical pulse sequence composed of a control pulse on the remote qubit (red) followed by a sensing pulse on the sensor qubit (blue). The control pulse can induce conditional or unconditional qubit rotations depending on its frequency content. (D) ESR spectra of the remote qubit measured with the tip positioned on the sensor qubit. The two curves correspond to different sensing frequencies (top, fS = f1; bottom, fS = f2). Insets: pulse sequence and ESR transitions involved in each spectrum. (E) Rabi oscillations of the remote qubit performed by simultaneously driving fR = f3 and f4 to induce unconditional qubit rotations. The sensing pulse was subsequently applied at fS = f1. Red curve is a fit to an exponentially decaying sinusoid. A second y axis on the right shows the population of state |0〉, which is determined by temperature and transition frequency at τR = 0 (here 90%) (3). (F) Two-axis control of the remote qubit shown by sweeping the relative phase φ between two consecutive π/2 pulses (fR = f3 and f4; fS = f1). The data have been vertically shifted by 300 fA to allow easier comparison to (E). φ = 180 degrees does not correspond to ΔI = 0 here because of the RF rectification effect [see section 4 of (19) and fig. S10]. Solid curve shows a cosine fit. The axes of the two-step qubit rotation are illustrated by red arrows on the Bloch sphere in the rotating frame. ESR conditions in (D): VDC = 50 mV, IDC = 20 pA, VS = VR = 30 mV, τR = τS = 200 ns; and in (E) and (F): VDC = 50 mV, IDC = 20 pA, VS = 50 mV, VR = 120 mV, τS = 200 ns. The sample was kept at 0.4 K during measurements.
