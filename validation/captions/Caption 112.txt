(A) We sought to identify genomic regions whose CG epimutation rates are invariable across genetic and environmental perturbations. To that end, we created seven MA pedigrees in various genetic backgrounds by using different natural accessions as founders (Col-0, Hi-0, Kn-0, Ler-0, Mt-0, Og-0, and Tsu-0). In addition, we generated MA lines grown under biotic stress [repeated exposure to P. syringae and salicylic acid (SA)] and combined these data with published MA lines grown under abiotic stress (exposure to high salinity and drought conditions). Using multigenerational WGBS data from these MA lines, we estimated CG epimutation rates in each of 36 annotated Arabidopsis chromatin states (CSs). Detailed information about pedigree topologies and WGBS sampling can be found in fig. S1. For each CS, the coefficient of variation (CV) in the gain and loss rates were calculated across pedigrees. (B) Low CV for the gain and the loss rates were identified in a cluster of CSs including S3, S4, S5, S6, and S9. Genomic regions indexed by these CSs were defined as epigenetic clock regions For comparison, a cluster of CSs including S18, S19, S23, S24, S25, S26, S32, S33, S34, S35, and S36 displayed high CVs, which were defined as non-clock regions (C to E) CG epimutation accumulation is plotted as a function of divergence time (Δt) for each MA pedigree. Dashed lines indicate model-based extrapolations of mCG divergence for MA lines with a Δt of <30 generations. For CS-clock regions (C), epimutation accumulation patterns were much more invariable across pedigrees than for non–CS-clock regions (E). Epimutation accumulation in gbM genes (D) closely resembled CS-clock regions, indicating that gbM genes can serve as a proxy for an epigenetic clock.
