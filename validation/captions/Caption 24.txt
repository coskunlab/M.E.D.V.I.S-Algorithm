(A) Diagram of the STELLAR architecture used in the memristor chip. The STELLAR algorithm features sign-based weight update calculation and reconfigurable threshold for the error sign calculation during the weight update stage. (B and C) Comparison of the classification accuracies (B) and the weight update energy consumptions (C) using the STELLAR and the conventional BP algorithm on the MNIST dataset in simulations. (B) and (C) show the results of different write variations when using the BP algorithm and the results of different thresholds in the STELLAR learning approach. The bars and error bars show the averages and standard deviations of the results of 10 repeated experiments, respectively. The dashed line in (B) shows the average accuracy obtained by BP without considering the write variations of the memristors. (D) Representations of weights with a differential conductance pair (left) and with 1T1R (center) and 2T2R (right) configurations. (E) Illustration of the cycle-parallel conductance tuning scheme. The red and blue rectangles represent the positive and negative memristor cells in each differential pair, respectively. The upward and downward arrows represent the SET and RESET operations on the associated memristor cell, respectively.
