(A) The image of the dog boneâ€“shaped GDS bar sample, of which the gauge section was processed by means of CT processing. (B) Cross-sectional schematic showing a sample-level GDS structure from surface (dark blue) to core (light gray). (C) 3D x-ray tomographic reconstruction of the gauge section of a GDS tubular sample (~0.45-mm thickness). (D and E) Cross-sectional EBSD images of the GDS alloy showing the distributions of grain-scaled morphology, orientation (D), and three types of boundaries defined with different misorientation angles (E) within a depth of 1.0 mm from the surface. HAGB, high-angle grain boundary; LAB, low-angle boundary. (F to H) The bright-field TEM images [(F) and (G)] at the positions of the white squares in (D) and that at the core (H), showing a hierarchical GDS structure. The insets in (F) to (H) are the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns.
