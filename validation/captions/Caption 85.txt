(A) SCRP spin states in the absence of CISS and in the presence of a static magnetic field B0 that is much greater than J, D, and the hyperfine interactions in both radicals for a singlet precursor. The enhanced absorptive (a) and emissive (e) microwave-induced EPR transitions are indicated. (B) Schematic of chiral molecules aligned parallel to B0. (C) TREPR spectra with θ = 0° expected for an achiral SCRP (blue trace) and for a chiral SCRP with an initial state having a 100% (red trace) or partial CISS contribution (black trace). (D) SCRP spin states for θ = 0° where the initial state has a 100% CISS contribution. (E) Schematic of chiral molecules aligned perpendicular to B0. (F) TREPR spectra with θ = 90° expected for an achiral SCRP (blue trace) and for a chiral SCRP with an initial state having 100% CISS contribution (red trace) or a partial CISS contribution (black trace, rescaled). (G) SCRP spin states for θ = 90° where the initial state has a 100% CISS contribution. The widths of the energy levels in (A), (D), and (G) indicate the population of the initial state, whereas the relative arrow thicknesses in the boxes depict the transition probabilities.
