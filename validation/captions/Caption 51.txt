(A) Energy-band structure of TDBG showing the four low-energy bands computed by using a continuum model with interlayer potential U = 0 meV and θ = 1.75°. Line cuts from the energy bands in (A) along Bloch wave vector kx = 0 for (B) U = 0 meV and (C) U = 80 meV. A dashed horizontal line indicates the position of the Fermi level (EF), which moves through the bands as the displacement field and carrier density are varied. The x-axis labels (g, k′, m, and k) denote high-symmetry points in the mini-Brillouin zone. (D) STM topographic image of the TDBG moiré pattern, with moiré wavelength λ = (8.1 ± 0.1) nm. (Inset) A magnified portion of the image showing the atomic lattice of graphene. A twist angle of θ = (1.74° ± 0.02°) was determined from the atomically resolved moiré lattice (42). The red dot indicates the ABBC symmetry position where the spectral maps with applied magnetic field were acquired. Tunneling setpoint I = 20 pA; VB = 100 mV; temperature T = 0.01 K. (E) Tunneling spectral maps in the D versus VB plane for B = 0 T. n0 (–n0) indicates the electron density at full filling of the C1 (V1) band. Setpoints: I = 20 pA, VB = 120 mV, T = 0.01 K. (F) Corresponding theory map for B = 0 T (continuum-model calculation). arb. units, arbitrary units.
