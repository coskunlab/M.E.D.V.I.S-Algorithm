(A) Performance comparison of the IC-PANF membrane with other state-of-the-art membranes for separating Na2SO4. The red star represents the as-prepared IC-PANF membrane (table S7). (B) Separation performance of IC-PANF membrane for various salts. (C) Water permeance, Na2SO4 rejection, and the co-ion Cl–/SO42– selectivity of IC-PANF membrane with varying feed concentrations. Error bars represent the SDs of three independent measurements.
