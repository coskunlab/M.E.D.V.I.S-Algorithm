(A) Electron transfer and intersystem-crossing pathways in a D-BÏ‡-A system with no applied magnetic field, where kCS1 and kCS2 are the charge-separation rate constants, kST is singlet-triplet mixing rate constant, and kCRS and kCRT are the charge recombination rates through the singlet and triplet channels, respectively. (B) Structures of chiral (R)-1 and (S)-1 and achiral 2. The steric constraints imposed by linking the two NMI groups in (R)-1 and (S)-1 result in stable enantiomers that have axial chirality.
