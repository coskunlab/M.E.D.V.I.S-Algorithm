(A) Representative images of injected zebrafish embryos at 48 hours post fertilization (hpf). Gross phenotypic scoring of anterior-posterior axis growth was sorted into three categories: normal, reduced, and severely reduced growth. (B) Scoring of anterior-posterior axis growth at 48 hpf. Zebrafish embryos were injected with 4-ng ezh2-MO or the same amount of control MO. For rescue experiments, 100 ng of mRNA encoding WT or mutated human EZH2 was coinjected with ezh2-MO. At least three clutches were examined for each injection. Fisherâ€™s exact test was used to determine the P values. (C) Dose-response experiments with 25, 50, and 100 ng of mRNA coinjected. Statistical analyses were performed as in (B) by comparing different doses with ezh2-MO alone. ns, not significant; *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001.
