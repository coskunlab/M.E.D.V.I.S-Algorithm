(A) Synteny schema depicting SCF1 and the conservation and orientation of adjacent ORFs. Genomic loci are shown compared with C. auris. Putative SCF1 homologs were only identified in C. auris and C. haemulonii. (B) Adhesion of 23 C. auris clinical isolates from all five clades. (C) Adhesion of 19 C. albicans clinical isolates from five clades. FC, fingerprint clade. (D) SCF1 transcript abundance (top panel), but not IFF4109 transcript abundance (bottom panel), is associated with adhesion to polystyrene in the same 23 C. auris isolates from (A). Log2 fold change (Log2FC) values are expressed relative to AR0382. Each point signifies the mean of three biological replicates. Pearson correlation coefficient and P value are indicated. Isolates that do not encode IFF4109 are not indicated in the bottom panel. (E) Comparison of adhesion between two clade I isolates: AR0382 and AR0387. Overexpression of SCF1 using the strong TEF1 promoter (right panel) is sufficient to drive adhesion in the poorly adhesive AR0387 background (left panel). Statistical differences were assessed using one-way ANOVA [(B) and (C)], Tukey’s post hoc test (E), or Student’s t test (E); *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001; ns: P > 0.05.
