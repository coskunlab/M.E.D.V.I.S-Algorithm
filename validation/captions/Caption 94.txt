(A to C) Nalm6 cells (5 × 106) were implanted subcutaneously into the hind flank of NSG mice. When tumor volumes reached ~100 mm3, mice were intratumorally injected with 1 × 105 CFU of engineered probiotic strains (ProX) producing diGFP (ProdiGFP) or Tag (ProTag) targets or an empty control (Pro−) (A). Then, 2.5 × 106 GFP28z+ ProCAR-T cells were delivered 48 hours post bacteria treatment (pbt), with tumor growth monitored by caliper measurements every 3 to 4 days. Mean tumor trajectories (B) and survival curves (C) are shown. Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 4 biological replicates. (D) ELISA quantification of sfGFP levels from tumor homogenates (left) and serum (right) on day 14 pbt; data represent SEM of n = 3 biological replicates. (E and F) MDA-MB-468 cells (5 × 106) were subcutaneously implanted into the hind flank of NSG mice. When tumors reached palpable volume, mice were intratumorally injected with 1 × 105 CFU of ProTag or control Pro− strains or PBS. On days 2 and 15 pbt, tumors were treated with 2.5 × 106 GFP28z+ ProCAR-T cells, and tumor growth was measured as in (A). Mean tumor trajectories are shown (F). Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 3 biological replicates. (G to K) Nalm6 tumors were established and treated as in (A) and resected on day 2 after T cell treatment (day 4 pbt) for analysis by flow cytometry. (H) Frequency of IT hCD45+CD3+CD8+ T cell memory and effector populations determined by CD62L and CD45RO expression patterns. Data represent mean ± SEM of n > 3 biological replicates. (I) Flow cytometric quantification of CD69 surface expression on IT hCD45+CD3+ CD8+ cells in each treatment group. Data represent mean ± SEM of n = 3 biological replicates. (J and K) Luminex quantification of IT IFN-γ (J) and TNF-α (K) concentrations. Data represent mean ± SD of biological replicates. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA [(B), (F), and (H)], log-rank test (C), or one-way ANOVA [(D), (I) to (K)], with Holm–Sidak multiple comparison correction.
