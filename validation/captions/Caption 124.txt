(A) Comparison of storage capacity and binding enthalpy for VDF in porous materials. The binding enthalpies and associated errors were determined using linear fits to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. (B) Comparison of storage capacity (blue) and binding enthalpy (red) for fluorinated gases in Mg2(dobdc). The binding enthalpies and associated errors were determined using linear fits to the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. (C) MAS 19F solid-state NMR spectrum of VDF-Mg2(dobdc) (blue) compared with solution-state 19F NMR spectrum of VDF in THF (red). (D) Rietveld refinement of VDF-Mg2(dobdc). Measured diffraction data (blue), fitted pattern (red), and the difference (black) are shown. Weighted residual factor (Rwp) = 11.9%. The inset shows the structural model for VDF-Mg2(dobdc).
