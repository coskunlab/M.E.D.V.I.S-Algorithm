(A) Schematic of the control scheme of a multi-qubit structure (Fig. 1C) composed of two remote qubits and a sensor qubit. (B) Energy diagram and ESR transitions used for the measurement in (C). (C) Controlled-controlled operation of remote qubit 1 performed by driving the transition |0〉|00〉 ↔ |0〉|10〉 [(A), red pulse; (B), red arrow]. Four different frequencies of the sensor qubit were used for sensing the four remote qubit states [(A), blue pulse; (B), blue arrows, where the detected states of the remote qubits are labeled by red kets in (C)]. The two oscillating curves in (C) (orange and magenta) correspond to detection of the remote qubits’ |00〉 or |10〉 states upon the controlled-controlled operation at |0〉|00〉 ↔ |0〉|10〉. The CCNOT operation time is ~20 ns (dotted line). The other two qubit states were not driven so they showed no oscillations. Green, orange, and blue curves are vertically shifted for clarity. (D) Strategy to perform single-, two-, and three-qubit operations in our platform. Single-qubit operations are performed by nonselectively exciting all ESR transitions of a qubit with the same strength. Two-qubit controlled operations were performed by selectively exciting ESR transitions that correspond to a specific quantum state of one control qubit. Three-qubit controlled-controlled operations are performed by selectively exciting ESR transitions that correspond to a specific quantum state of multiple control qubits. ESR conditions in (C): VDC = 50 mV, IDC = 20 pA, VS = 50 mV, VR = 80 mV, τS = 200 ns. The sample was kept at 0.4 K during measurements.
