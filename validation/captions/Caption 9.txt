(A) Untargeted lipid analysis of HEK293T lysosomes upon CLN5 loss. Data presented as volcano plot of log2-transformed fold change in the abundance of lipids between CLN5 knockout and wild-type HEK293T lysosomes. Significantly altered lipids include LPG (red) and BMP (yellow). BMP/PG (blue) annotation indicates compounds for which fragmentation data was not acquired. Data in table S1. The horizontal line indicates a P-value of 0.05 and the vertical line indicates a fold change of 2. Each genotype measurement represents n = 4 biologically independent samples. P-values were calculated by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test and corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg method with an FDR = 5%. (B and C) Targeted analyses of BMP and LPG in whole cells and lysosomes. Fold changes in lysosomal BMPs and LPGs between CLN5 knockout and wild-type HEK293T cells were calculated after subtracting background from control samples and normalizing to endogenous lipid. If species is not detected in wild-type cells, normalized abundance is presented. Data presented as mean Â± SD of n = 4 biologically independent samples. (D) Targeted lipid analysis of LPG and BMP normalized abundances from CLN5-deficient iPSCs and iNeurons compared with the WT. Plotted values are normalized to endogenous lipids. Data presented as mean of n = 3 biologically independent samples. ND, not detected. WT, wild-type.
