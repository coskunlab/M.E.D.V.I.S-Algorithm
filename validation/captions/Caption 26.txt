(A) Illustration of the motion control task (left) and its control system (right). (B) Illustration of the learning of new samples in the light-chasing car task. (C) Changes in the scores over the course of on-chip improvement learning of bright scene samples. The lines and the error bars show the averages and standard deviations of the scores of 10 repeated experiments with shuffled training sets, respectively. (D) The initial and final scores in (C). (E) The evolution of the weight distribution (100 × 10) before (top) and after (middle) the on-chip improvement learning. Bottom: distribution of the weight changes. (F) Illustration of the learning of a new class in the image classification task. (G) Changes in the accuracies over the course of on-chip improvement learning of the new class, showing the results from 10 repeated experiments with 150 randomly selected images from the training set each time. (H) The initial accuracies and the accuracies achieved after on-chip improvement learning of 100 iterations in (G). (I) The evolution of the weight distribution (100 × 10) before (top) and after (middle) the on-chip improvement learning. Bottom: Distribution of the weight changes.
