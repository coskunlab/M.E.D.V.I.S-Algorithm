(A) Percent FOXP3(GFP)–negative among dTOMATO+ CD4 cells with I-Ab:2W1S fetal specificity or tetramer-negative bulk cells in pooled secondary lymphoid organs for FOXP3(GFP)CRE R26dTOMATO mice without prior pregnancy (virgin, black), or mice 30 days after primary pregnancy sired by OVA:2W1S+ BALB/c males treated with rabbit IgG (blue) or α-OVA IgG (red) on days 2 and 16 after parturition. (B) Percent FOXP3(GFP)–negative cells among dTOMATO+ CD4 cells with I-Ab:2W1S surrogate fetal specificity or tetramer-negative bulk cells in pooled secondary lymphoid organs of FOXP3(GFP)CRE R26dTOMATO mice after primary pregnancy sired by OVA:2W1S+ BALB/c males (blue) or additional secondary pregnancy sired by third-party H-2k+ CBA males (red). (C) Expression of each molecule by FOXP3(GFP)+ compared with FOXP3(GFP)–negative cells among dTOMATO+ CD4 cells with I-Ab:2W1S surrogate fetal specificity in PP mice after primary pregnancy by OVA:2W1S+ BALB/c males (blue) or in PP mice with OVA:2W1S+ FMc depletion by α-OVA IgG (red circles) or FMc displacement with secondary pregnancy by H-2k+ CBA males (red squares). gMFI, geometric mean fluorescent intensity. (D) Percent FOXP3+ among PP donor CD90.2+ CD45.1+ FOXP3DTR (solid) or PP donor CD90.2+ CD45.2+ FOXP3WT (open) CD4 cells with I-Ab:2W1S fetal specificity in pooled secondary lymphoid organs of CD90.1+ (CD90.2-negative) recipients midgestation (E11.5) during allogenic pregnancy sired by OVA:2W1S+ BALB/c males administered DT for 2 consecutive days after adoptive cell transfer and before mating. Splenocytes from PP FOXP3DTR and FOXP3WT donors were harvested 30 days after primary pregnancy by OVA:2W1S+ BALB/c males, with some mice administered α-OVA or rabbit IgG (on days 2 and 16 after parturition). (E) Percent fetal wastage and average recoverable CFUs from concepti in each litter, 5 days after maternal Lm infection midgestation (E11.5) for mice during primary pregnancy sired by OVA:2W1S+ H-2d BALB/c males adoptively transferred donor splenocytes 1 day prior (E10.5) from isogenic virgin mice (black), PP FOXP3WT (blue), PP FOXP3DTR (red filled) (depletion of donor FOXP3+ cells), or PP FOXP3(GFP)CRE R26iDTR (open red) (depletion of FOXP3+ cells and ex-Treg cells) and administered DT for two consecutive days (E10.5 and E11.5). Each point indicates the data from an individual mouse and is representative of at least three independent experiments, each with similar results. Bar, mean ± standard error.
