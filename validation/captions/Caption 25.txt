(A) Overview of the architecture of the memristor chip. (B) Optical microscope image of the chip, where several key components are labeled. (C) A cross-section transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image showing 2T2R cells. The transistors in a 2T2R cell share a common source terminal. Inset: Cross-section TEM image of the memristor device. (D) On-chip classification accuracy obtained for each class by using the off-chip trained weights for the MNIST dataset, with bars and error bars showing the averages and standard deviations of the accuracies achieved over five inference iterations, respectively. The standard deviations ranged from 0.07 to 0.27. (E) Changes in the classification accuracy over 48 days after weight transfer, with each point showing the average accuracy over five inference results. Inset: The average changes in the accuracy of each class after 48 days of weight transfer. The standard deviations in the inset ranged from 0.1 to 0.32. (F) Changes in the classification accuracy over three learning epochs in the on-chip learning task for the MNIST dataset, with each epoch including 60,000 iterations. (G) Energy breakdown of the memristor chip during the on-chip learning process.
