(A) PCA on open-ended capacity, mimicry capacity, and log of vocalization repertoire (songs and calls). PC1 explains 69.9% of the variance and was used as our index of vocal learning complexity. (B) The higher the vocal learning complexity, the better the problem-solving performance among species. (C to E) Speciesâ€™ associative learning (C), reversal learning (D), and self-control (E) performances are not associated with vocal learning complexity. Values are ranked means of species performance from all individuals (sample sizes are shown in the legend). R and P values are from Spearman correlations. ***P < 0.001; ns, not significant.
