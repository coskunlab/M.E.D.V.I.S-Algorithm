Inactive mines are shown by solid yellow circles, active mines by open red circles, and failed TSFs by purple triangles. The y-axis units are log10 numbers. Symbols for inactive and active mines indicate predicted values from the WAPHA model with 90% confidence intervals; symbols for failed TSFs are observed values for total river length and floodplain areas affected by 257 documented TDFs. Inactive metal mines have a substantially larger global environmental impact on river channels, floodplains, and valley floors located within the 100-year inundation zone than active mines. Although the impact of failed TSFs on river systems worldwide is considerable, the combined environmental effect of inactive and active mines on river channels and floodplains is estimated to be 30 to 90 times larger.
