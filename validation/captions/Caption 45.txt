(A) Measured dislocation propagation distances in diamond (xd) as a function of the XFEL delay (t). The xd = 0 μm denotes the interface between the ablator and diamond, whereas t = 0 ns denotes the time that the laser hits the ablator. The blue circles and red squares represent our experimental results for the [100] and [110] shock directions, respectively. The velocities of the dislocation propagation (vd) noted are obtained from the slope of the linear fits (solid lines). The error bars on each plot represent 1σ of multiple measurements. The shot-by-shot fluctuation of drive laser intensity is not included in the error bars shown on xd. The errors on vd are evaluated on the basis of the 1σ of the fitting and the errors on each plot. (B) vd versus the diamond’s material density the shocked states. Black curves are the calculated c1, c2, and c3 of diamond propagating along [110] direction (18). The error bars on are propagated from the errors on the plastic shock wave velocities (18).
