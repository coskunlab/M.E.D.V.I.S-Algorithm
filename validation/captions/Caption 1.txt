(A) Phylogenetic tree of the species that were studied based on (42). Inside circle colors indicate the type of vocal learning, perimeter circle colors indicate domesticated versus wild species, and circle size is proportional to vocalization repertoire size. (B) Comparisons of song and call repertoire sizes in open- versus closed-ended vocal learning songbirds (n = 21 species). (C) Comparison of mimic and nonmimic species. Black * and ** indicate significant PANOVA at <0.05 and <0.01, respectively. Green * and ** indicate significant PAOV.PHYLO (ANOVA accounting for phylogenetic relationships). ns, not significant. Full statistical values are provided in table S2. Bars are means Â± SEM.
