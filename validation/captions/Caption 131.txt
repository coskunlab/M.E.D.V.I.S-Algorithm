(A and B) Polyethylene central venous catheters were set in rat jugular veins and inoculated intraluminally with C. auris. Representative scanning electron microscopy images of the luminal catheter surface are shown from catheters collected 24 hours after infection. Scale bars: 400 μm (100×), 40 μm (1000×), and 5 μm (5000×). (C and D) Full thickness human skin explants were colonized with C. auris for 24 hours before washing to remove unassociated cells. Representative scanning electron microscopy images of the skin surface after washing are shown. Scale bars: 20 μm (1000×) and 4 μm (5000×). (E to G) Immunosuppressed mice were infected intravenously (through tail vein injection) with 5 × 107 C. auris cells. Histopathology sections of the kidneys 7 days after infection [(E) and (F)] were stained with periodic acid–Schiff. Magenta color indicates lesion areas. Ten infected mice for each strain were monitored for survival for 21 days (G). Statistical comparisons of overall survival were assessed using the Mantel-Haenszel log-rank test with Benjamini-Hochberg correction; *P ≤ 0.05; **P ≤ 0.01; ***P ≤ 0.001; ns P > 0.05.
