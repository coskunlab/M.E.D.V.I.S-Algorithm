(A) Levels of OVA DNA specific to OVA:2W1S+ FMcs from primary pregnancy or H-2k DNA specific to H-2k+ FMcs from secondary pregnancy in each tissue among C57BL/6 female mice 9 to 10 weeks after a single pregnancy sired by OVA:2W1S+ H-2d BALB/c males (blue) compared with mice 3 weeks after second pregnancy sired by H-2k+ CBA males (red). (B) Representative plots and composite data showing percent FOXP3+ among CD4 cells with I-Ab:2W1S surrogate fetal specificity and numbers of I-Ab:2W1S+ CD4 cells in pooled secondary lymphoid organs for the mice described in (A). (C) Percent fetal wastage, average recoverable CFUs from concepti in each litter, and number of live pups per litter 5 days after maternal Lm infection at midgestation (E11.5) for naïve mice during primary pregnancy sired by H-2d BALB/c males (black), compared with mice during secondary pregnancy sired by H-2d BALB/c males (blue) or during tertiary pregnancy sired by H-2d BALB/c males with intervening secondary pregnancy sired by H-2k CBA males (red). Each point indicates the data from an individual mouse and is representative of at least three independent experiments, each with similar results. Bar, mean ± standard error.
