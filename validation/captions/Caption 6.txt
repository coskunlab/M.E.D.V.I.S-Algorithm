Bland-Altman MA plot showing differential expression of genes from RNA sequencing of human grafts from control and amyloid mice at (A) 2 months (control n = 5, amyloid n = 7), (B) 6 months (control n = 5, amyloid n = 5), and (C) 18 months (control n = 4, amyloid n = 3) after transplantation. Red indicates significantly up-regulated genes. Blue indicates significantly down-regulated genes [false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05]. FC, fold change; CPM, counts per million. (D) GO analysis showing terms associated with genes up-regulated at 6 months. Point size represents the fold enrichment of up-regulated genes in the term, and color represents the –log10FDR. Only terms with FDR < 0.1 are shown. The x and y axes represent the  (54). (E) Heatmap of normalized enrichment scores (NES) in neuronal dedifferentiation gene sets ranked along the differentially expressed genes in the xenografts (amyloid versus control) shown in (A) to (C). Positive enrichments in red, negative enrichments in blue. Significant FDR values (Padj < 0.01) are shown as numbers. (F to H) Analysis of (F) RIPK1, (G) RIPK3, and (H) MLKL mRNA expression using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) on AD (n = 11) and control (n = 10) postmortem human brain samples. (I) Analysis of MEG3 gene expression using qRT-PCR on AD (n = 11) and control (n = 10) postmortem human brain samples. (J) Confocal images showing MEG3 RNAscope in the temporal gyrus of AD (n = 3) and control (n = 2) postmortem human brain samples. Scale bars: 10 μm. (K) Number of MEG3 puncta per nucleus in control (>100 nuclei per sample, n = 2) and AD (>100 nuclei per sample, n = 3). (L) Representative confocal images showing the expression of activated necroptosis pathway markers pRIPK1, pRIPK3, or pMLKL in red (white arrows) in 18-month-old human neurons in control (n = 4) and amyloid (n = 4) mice. Scale bars: 30 μm. Values are presented as mean ± SEM. Student’s t test used in (F) to (I) and (K).
