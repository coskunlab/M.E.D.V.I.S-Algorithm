(A) Schrodinger docking of LPG (18:1) onto an experimental BMPS structure (PDB 6R99). Predicted catalytic triad residues C231, H117, and E134 are annotated. (B) Weaker serine nucleophile attenuates BMPS activity as measured by monitoring GPG release. Recombinant BMPS WT and C231S were incubated with LPG (18:1) under acidic conditions. Data presented as mean ± SD of n = 3 biologically independent samples. (C and D) Recombinant BMPS C231S exhibits reduced rescue of LPG storage and BMP deficiency. Fold change in the levels of BMP and LPG species normalized to endogenous lipid. Data presented as mean ± SD of n = 4 biologically independent samples. (E) Diagram of the BMPS reaction mechanism. The BMPS active site thiol substitutes at the LPG carbonyl carbon releasing a GPG byproduct and abstracting an acyl chain to form a high-energy enzyme-acyl intermediate. Through a base-exchange reaction, the electrophilic intermediate is substituted at its carbonyl carbon by an LPG alcohol to complete the catalytic cycle and release BMP.
