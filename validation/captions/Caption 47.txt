Modeled ages for (A) track horizons TH1 through TH7 and (B) the start and end boundaries for the entire footprint horizon interval based on the calibrated 14C ages of pollen and Ruppia seeds. Both figures were generated using the Sequence function in OxCal v.4.4.4 (32) and the IntCal20 calibration curve (23), which we accessed online 30 May 2023. Samples identified as outliers at the 95% confidence level were excluded from the analyses (22).
